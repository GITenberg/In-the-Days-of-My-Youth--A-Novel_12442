<h3>MY BIRTHPLACE AND PARENTAGE.</h3>
<center>Dolce sentier,<br>
Colle, che mi piacesti,<br>
Ov'ancor per usanza amor mi mena!<br>
<br>
PETRARCH.</center>
<br>
<p>Sweet, secluded, shady Saxonholme! I doubt if our whole England
contains another hamlet so quaint, so picturesquely irregular, so
thoroughly national in all its rustic characteristics. It lies in a
warm hollow environed by hills. Woods, parks and young plantations
clothe every height and slope for miles around, whilst here and
there, peeping down through green vistas, or towering above
undulating seas of summer foliage, stands many a fine old country
mansion, turreted and gabled, and built of that warm red brick that
seems to hold the light of the sunset long after it has faded from
the rest of the landscape. A silver thread of streamlet, swift but
shallow, runs noisily through the meadows beside the town and loses
itself in the Chad, about a mile and a half farther eastward. Many
a picturesque old wooden bridge, many a foaming weir and ruinous
water-mill with weedy wheel, may be found scattered up and down the
wooded banks of this little river Chad; while to the brook, which
we call the Gipstream, attaches a vague tradition of trout.</p>
<p>The hamlet itself is clean and old-fashioned, consisting of one
long, straggling street, and a few tributary lanes and passages.
The houses some few years back were mostly long and low-fronted,
with projecting upper stories, and diamond-paned bay-windows
bowered in with myrtle and clematis; but modern improvements have
done much of late to sweep away these antique tenements, and a fine
new suburb of Italian and Gothic villas has sprung up, between the
town and the railway station. Besides this, we have a new church in
the medi&aelig;val style, rich in gilding and colors and
thirteenth-century brass-work; and a new cemetery, laid out like a
pleasure-garden; and a new school-house, where the children are
taught upon a system with a foreign name; and a Mechanics'
Institute, where London professors come down at long intervals to
expound popular science, and where agriculturists meet to discuss
popular grievances.</p>
<p>At the other extremity of the town, down by Girdlestone Grange,
an old moated residence where the squire's family have resided
these four centuries past, we are full fifty years behind our
modern neighbors. Here stands our famous old "King's-head Inn," a
well-known place of resort so early as the reign of Elizabeth. The
great oak beside the porch is as old as the house itself; and on
the windows of a little disused parlor overlooking the garden may
still be seen the names of Sedley, Rochester and other wits of the
Restoration. They scrawled those autographs after dinner, most
likely, with their diamond rings, and went reeling afterwards,
arm-in-arm, along the village street, singing and swearing, and
eager for adventures--as gentlemen were wont to be in those famous
old times when they drank the king's health more freely than was
good for their own.</p>
<p>Not far from the "King's Head," and almost hidden by the trees
which divide it from the road, stands an ancient charitable
institution called the College--quadrangular, mullion-windowed,
many-gabled, and colonized by some twenty aged people of both
sexes. At the back of the college, adjoining a space of waste
ground and some ruined cloisters, lies the churchyard, in the midst
of which, surrounded by solemn yews and mouldering tombs, stands
the Priory Church. It is a rare old church, founded, according to
the county history, in the reign of Edward the Confessor, and
entered with a full description in Domesday Book. Its sculptured
monuments and precious brasses, its Norman crypt, carved stalls and
tattered banners drooping over faded scutcheons, tell all of
generations long gone by, of noble families extinct, of gallant
deeds forgotten, of knights and ladies remembered only by the names
above their graves. Amongst these, some two or three modest tablets
record the passing away of several generations of my own
predecessors--obscure professional men for the most part, of whom
some few became soldiers and died abroad.</p>
<p>In close proximity to the church stands the vicarage, once the
Priory; a quaint old rambling building, surrounded by magnificent
old trees. Here for long centuries, a tribe of rooks have held
undisputed possession, filling the boughs with their nests and the
air with their voices, and, like genuine lords of the soil,
descending at their own grave will and pleasure upon the adjacent
lands.</p>
<p>Picturesque and medi&aelig;val as all these old buildings and
old associations help to make us, we of Saxonholme pretend to
something more. We claim to be, not only picturesque but historic.
Nay, more than this--we are classical. WE WERE FOUNDED BY THE
ROMANS. A great Roman road, well known to antiquaries, passed
transversely through the old churchyard. Roman coins and relics,
and fragments of tesselated pavement, have been found in and about
the town. Roman camps may be traced on most of the heights around.
Above all, we are said to be indebted to the Romans for that
inestimable breed of poultry in right of which we have for years
carried off the leading prizes at every poultry-show in the county,
and have even been enabled to make head against the exaggerated
pretensions of modern Cochin-China interlopers.</p>
<p>Such, briefly sketched, is my native Saxonholme. Born beneath
the shade of its towering trees and overhanging eaves, brought up
to reverence its antiquities, and educated in the love of its
natural beauties, what wonder that I cling to it with every fibre
of my heart, and even when affecting to smile at my own fond
prejudice, continue to believe it the loveliest peacefulest nook in
rural England?</p>
<p>My father's name was John Arbuthnot. Sprung from the Arbuthnots
of Montrose, we claim to derive from a common ancestor with the
celebrated author of "Martinus Scriblerus." Indeed, the first of
our name who settled at Saxonholme was one James Arbuthnot, son to
a certain nonjuring parson Arbuthnot, who lived and died abroad,
and was own brother to that famous wit, physician and courtier
whose genius, my father was wont to say, conferred a higher
distinction upon our branch of the family than did those Royal
Letters-Patent whereby the elder stock was ennobled by His most
Gracious Majesty King George the Fourth, on the occasion of his
visit to Edinburgh in 1823. From this James Arbuthnot (who, being
born and bred at St. Omer, and married, moreover, to a French wife,
was himself half a Frenchman) we Saxonholme Arbuthnots were the
direct descendants.</p>
<p>Our French ancestress, according to the family tradition, was of
no very exalted origin, being in fact the only daughter and heiress
of one Monsieur Tartine, Perruquier in chief at the Court of
Versailles. But what this lady wanted in birth, she made up in
fortune, and the modest estate which her husband purchased with her
dowry came down to us unimpaired through five generations. In the
substantial and somewhat foreign-looking red-brick house which he
built (also, doubtless, with Madame's Louis d'ors) we, his
successors, had lived and died ever since. His portrait, together
with the portraits of his wife, son, and grandson, hung on the
dining-room walls; and of the quaint old spindle-legged chairs and
tables that had adorned our best rooms from time immemorial, some
were supposed to date as far back as the first founding and
furnishing of the house.</p>
<p>It is almost needless to say that the son of the non-juror and
his immediate posterity were staunch Jacobites, one and all. I am
not aware that they ever risked or suffered anything for the cause;
but they were not therefore the less vehement. Many were the signs
and tokens of that dead-and-gone political faith which these loyal
Arbuthnots left behind them. In the bed-rooms there hung prints of
King James the Second at the Battle of the Boyne; of the Royal
Martyr with his plumed hat, lace collar, and melancholy fatal face;
of the Old and Young Pretenders; of the Princess Louisa Teresia,
and of the Cardinal York. In the library were to be found all kinds
of books relating to the career of that unhappy family: "Ye
Tragicall History of ye Stuarts, 1697;" "Memoirs of King James II.,
writ by his own hand;" "La Stuartide," an unfinished epic in the
French language by one Jean de Schelandre; "The Fate of Majesty
exemplified in the barbarous and disloyal treatment (by traitorous
and undutiful subjects) of the Kings and Queens of the Royal House
of Stuart," genealogies of the Stuarts in English, French and
Latin; a fine copy of "Eikon Basilike," bound in old red morocco,
with the royal arms stamped upon the cover; and many other volumes
on the same subject, the names of which (although as a boy I was
wont to pore over their contents with profound awe and sympathy) I
have now for the most part forgotten.</p>
<p>Most persons, I suppose, have observed how the example of a
successful ancestor is apt to determine the pursuits of his
descendants down to the third and fourth generations, inclining the
lads of this house to the sea, and of that to the bar, according as
the great man of the family achieved his honors on shipboard, or
climbed his way to the woolsack. The Arbuthnots offered no
exception to this very natural law of selection. They could not
help remembering how the famous doctor had excelled in literature
as in medicine; how he had been not only Physician in Ordinary to
Queen Anne and Prince George of Denmark, but a satirist and
pamphleteer, a wit and the friend of wits--of such wits as Pope and
Swift, Harley and Bolingbroke. Hence they took, as it were
instinctively, to physic and the <i>belles lettres</i>, and were
never without a doctor or an author in the family.</p>
<p>My father, however, like the great Martinus Scriblerus, was both
doctor and author. And he was a John Arbuthnot. And to carry the
resemblance still further, he was gifted with a vein of rough
epigrammatic humor, in which it pleased his independence to indulge
without much respect of persons, times, or places. His tongue,
indeed, cost him some friends and gained him some enemies; but I am
not sure that it diminished his popularity as a physician. People
compared him to Abernethy, whereby he was secretly flattered. Some
even went so far as to argue that only a very clever man could
afford to be a bear; and I must say that he pushed this conclusion
to its farthest limit, showing his temper alike to rich and poor
upon no provocation whatever. He cared little, to be sure, for his
connection. He loved the profession theoretically, and from a
scientific point of view; but he disliked the drudgery of country
practice, and stood in no need of its hardly-earned profits. Yet he
was a man who so loved to indulge his humor, no matter at what
cost, that I doubt whether he would have been more courteous had
his bread depended on it. As it was, he practised and grumbled,
snarled at his patients, quarrelled with the rich, bestowed his
time and money liberally upon the poor, and amused his leisure by
writing for a variety of scientific periodicals, both English and
foreign.</p>
<p>Our home stood at the corner of a lane towards the eastern
extremity of the town, commanding a view of the Squire's Park, and
a glimpse of the mill-pool and meadows in the valley beyond. This
lane led up to Barnard's Green, a breezy space of high, uneven
ground dedicated to fairs, cricket matches, and travelling
circuses, whence the noisy music of brass bands, and the echoes of
alternate laughter and applause, were wafted past our windows in
the summer evenings. We had a large garden at the back, and a
stable up the lane; and though the house was but one story in
height, it covered a considerable space of ground, and contained
more rooms than we ever had occasion to use. Thus it happened that
since my mother's death, which took place when I was a very little
boy, many doors on the upper floor were kept locked, to the undue
development of my natural inquisitiveness by day, and my mortal
terror when sent to bed at night. In one of these her portrait
still hung above the mantelpiece, and her harp stood in its
accustomed corner. In another, which was once her bedroom,
everything was left as in her lifetime, her clothes yet hanging in
the wardrobe, her dressing-case standing upon the toilet, her
favorite book upon the table beside the bed. These things, told to
me by the servants with much mystery, took a powerful hold upon my
childish imagination. I trembled as I passed the closed doors at
dusk, and listened fearfully outside when daylight gave me courage
to linger near them. Something of my mother's presence, I fancied,
must yet dwell within--something in her shape still wander from
room to room in the dim moonlight, and echo back the sighing of the
night winds. Alas! I could not remember her. Now and then, as if
recalled by a dream, some broken and shadowy images of a pale face
and a slender hand floated vaguely through my mind; but faded even
as I strove to realize them. Sometimes, too, when I was falling off
to sleep in my little bed, or making out pictures in the fire on a
winter evening, strange fragments of old rhymes seemed to come back
upon me, mingled with the tones of a soft voice and the haunting of
a long-forgotten melody. But these, after all, were yearnings more
of the heart than the memory:--</p>
<blockquote>"I felt a mother-want about the world.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still went seeking."</blockquote>
<p>To return to my description of my early home:--the two rooms on
either side of the hall, facing the road, were appropriated by my
father for his surgery and consulting-room; while the two
corresponding rooms at the back were fitted up as our general
reception-room, and my father's bed-room. In the former of these,
and in the weedy old garden upon which it opened, were passed all
the days of my boyhood.</p>
<p>It was my father's good-will and pleasure to undertake the sole
charge of my education. Fain would I have gone like other lads of
my age to public school and college; but on this point, as on most
others, he was inflexible. Himself an obscure physician in a remote
country town, he brought me up with no other view than to be his
own successor. The profession was not to my liking. Somewhat
contemplative and nervous by nature, there were few pursuits for
which I was less fitted. I knew this, but dared not oppose him.
Loving study for its own sake, and trusting to the future for some
lucky turn of destiny, I yielded to that which seemed inevitable,
and strove to make the best of it.</p>
<p>Thus it came to pass that I lived a quiet, hard-working home
life, while other boys of my age were going through the joyous
experience of school, and chose my companions from the dusty
shelves of some three or four gigantic book-cases, instead of from
the class and the playground. Not that I regret it. I believe, on
the contrary, that a boy may have worse companions than books and
busts, employments less healthy than the study of anatomy, and
amusements more pernicious than Shakespeare and Horace. Thank
Heaven! I escaped all such; and if, as I have been told, my boyhood
was unboyish, and my youth prematurely cultivated, I am content to
have been spared the dangers in exchange for the pleasures of a
public school.</p>
<p>I do not, however, pretend to say that I did not sometimes pine
for the recreations common to my age. Well do I remember the
manifold attractions of Barnard's Green. What longing glances I
used to steal towards the boisterous cricketers, when going gravely
forth upon a botanical walk with my father! With what eager
curiosity have I not lingered many a time before the entrance to a
forbidden booth, and scanned the scenic advertisement of a
travelling show! Alas! how the charms of study paled before those
intervals of brief but bitter temptation! What, then, was pathology
compared to the pig-faced lady, or the Materia Medica to Smith's
Mexican Circus, patronized by all the sovereigns of Europe? But my
father was inexorable. He held that such places were, to use his
own words, "opened by swindlers for the ruin of fools," and from
one never-to-be-forgotten hour, when he caught me in the very act
of taking out my penny-worth at a portable peep-show, he bound me
over by a solemn promise (sealed by a whipping) never to repeat the
offence under any provocation or pretext whatsoever. I was a tiny
fellow in pinafores when this happened, but having once pledged my
word, I kept it faithfully through all the studious years that lay
between six and sixteen.</p>
<p>At sixteen an immense crisis occurred in my life. I fell in
love. I had been in love several times before--chiefly with the
elder pupils at the Miss Andrews' establishment; and once (but that
was when I was very young indeed) with the cook. This, however, was
a much more romantic and desperate affair. The lady was a Columbine
by profession, and as beautiful as an angel. She came down to our
neighborhood with a strolling company, and performed every evening,
in a temporary theatre on the green, for nearly three weeks. I used
to steal out after dinner when my father was taking his nap, and
run the whole way, that I might be in time to see the object of my
adoration walking up and down the platform outside the booth before
the performances commenced. This incomparable creature wore a blue
petticoat spangled with tinfoil, and a wreath of faded poppies. Her
age might have been about forty. I thought her the loveliest of
created beings. I wrote sonnets to her--dozens of them--intending
to leave them at the theatre door, but never finding the courage to
do it. I made up bouquets for her, over and over again, chosen from
the best flowers in our neglected garden; but invariably with the
same result. I hated the harlequin who presumed to put his arm
about her waist. I envied the clown, whom she condescended to
address as Mr. Merriman. In short, I was so desperately in love
that I even tried to lie awake at night and lose my appetite; but,
I am ashamed to own, failed signally in both endeavors.</p>
<p>At length I wrote to her. I can even now recall passages out of
that passionate epistle. I well remember how it took me a whole
morning to write it; how I crammed it with quotations from Horace;
and how I fondly compared her to most of the mythological
divinities. I then copied it out on pale pink paper, folded it in
the form of a heart, and directed it to Miss Angelina Lascelles,
and left it, about dusk, with the money-taker at the pit door. I
signed myself, if I remember rightly, Pyramus. What would I not
have given that evening to pay my sixpence like the rest of the
audience, and feast my eyes upon her from some obscure corner! What
would I not have given to add my quota to the applause!</p>
<p>I could hardly sleep that night; I could hardly read or write,
or eat my breakfast the next morning, for thinking of my letter and
its probable effect. It never once occurred to me that my Angelina
might possibly find it difficult to construe Horace. Towards
evening, I escaped again, and flew to Barnard's Green. It wanted
nearly an hour to the time of performance; but the tuning of a
violin was audible from within, and the money-taker was already
there with his pipe in his mouth and his hands in his pockets. I
had no courage to address that functionary; but I lingered in his
sight and sighed audibly, and wandered round and round the canvas
walls that hedged my divinity. Presently he took his pipe out of,
his mouth and his hands out of his pockets; surveyed me
deliberately from head to foot, and said:--</p>
<p>"Hollo there! aint you the party that brought a three-cornered
letter here last evening!"</p>
<p>I owned it, falteringly.</p>
<p>He lifted a fold in the canvas, and gave me a gentle shove
between the shoulders.</p>
<p>"Then you're to go in," said he, shortly. "She's there,
somewhere. You're sure to find her."</p>
<p>The canvas dropped behind me, and I found myself inside. My
heart beat so fast that I could scarcely breathe. The booth was
almost dark; the curtain was down; and a gentleman with striped
legs was lighting the footlamps. On the front pit bench next the
orchestra, discussing a plate of bread and meat and the contents of
a brown jug, sat a stout man in shirt-sleeves and a woman in a
cotton gown. The woman rose as I made my appearance, and asked,
civilly enough, whom I pleased to want.</p>
<p>I stammered the name of Miss Angelina Lascelles.</p>
<p>"Miss Lascelles!" she repeated. "I am Miss Lascelles," Then,
looking at me more narrowly, "I suppose," she added, "you are the
little boy that brought the letter?"</p>
<p>The little boy that brought the letter! Gracious heavens! And
this middle-aged woman in a cotton gown--was she the Angelina of my
dreams! The booth went round with me, and the lights danced before
my eyes.</p>
<p>"If you have come for an answer," she continued, "you may just
say to your Mr. Pyramid that I am a respectable married woman, and
he ought to be ashamed of himself--and, as for his letter, I never
read such a heap of nonsense in my life! There, you can go out by
the way you came in, and if you take my advice, you won't come back
again!"</p>
<p>How I looked, what I said, how I made my exit, whether the
doorkeeper spoke to me as I passed, I have no idea to this day. I
only know that I flung myself on the dewy grass under a great tree
in the first field I came to, and shed tears of such shame,
disappointment, and wounded pride, as my eyes had never known
before. She had called me a little boy, and my letter a heap of
nonsense! She was elderly--she was ignorant--she was married! I had
been a fool; but that knowledge came too late, and was not
consolatory.</p>
<p>By-and-by, while I was yet sobbing and disconsolate, I heard the
drumming and fifing which heralded the appearance of the <i>Corps
Dramatique</i> on the outer platform. I resolved to see her for the
last time. I pulled my hat over my eyes, went back to the Green,
and mingled with the crowd outside the booth. It was growing dusk.
I made my way to the foot of the ladder, and observed her narrowly.
I saw that her ankles were thick, and her elbows red. The illusion
was all over. The spangles had lost their lustre, and the poppies
their glow. I no longer hated the harlequin, or envied the clown,
or felt anything but mortification at my own folly.</p>
<p>"Miss Angelina Lascelles, indeed!" I said to myself, as I
sauntered moodily home. "Pshaw! I shouldn't wonder if her name was
Snooks!"</p>

<p>My adventure with Miss Lascelles did me good service, and cured
me for some time, at least, of my leaning towards the tender
passion. I consequently devoted myself more closely than ever to my
studies--indulged in a passing mania for genealogy and
heraldry--began a collection of local geological specimens, all of
which I threw away at the end of the first fortnight--and took to
rearing rabbits in an old tumble-down summer-house at the end of
the garden. I believe that from somewhere about this time I may
also date the commencement of a great epic poem in blank verse, and
Heaven knows how many cantos, which was to be called the Columbiad.
It began, I remember, with a description of the Court of Ferdinand
and Isabella, and the departure of Columbus, and was intended to
celebrate the discovery, colonization, and subsequent history of
America. I never got beyond ten or a dozen pages of the first
canto, however, and that Transatlantic epic remains unfinished to
this day.</p>
<p>The great event which I have recorded in the preceding chapter
took place in the early summer. It must, therefore, have been
towards the close of autumn in the same year when my next important
adventure befell. This time the temptation assumed a different
shape.</p>
<p>Coming briskly homewards one fine frosty morning after having
left a note at the Vicarage, I saw a bill-sticker at work upon a
line of dead wall which at that time reached from the Red Lion Inn
to the corner of Pitcairn's Lane. His posters were printed in
enormous type, and decorated with a florid bordering in which the
signs of the zodiac conspicuously figured Being somewhat idly
disposed, I followed the example of other passers-by, and lingered
to watch the process and read the advertisement. It ran as
follows:----</p>

<p>SOIREE FANTASTIQUE</p>
<p>IN</p>
<p>THE LARGE ROOM OF THE RED LION HOTEL.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>ADMISSION 1s. RESERVED SEATS 2s. 6d.</p>
<p><i>To commence at Seven</i>.</p>
<p>N.B.--<i>The performance will include a variety of new and
surprising feats of Legerdemain never before exhibited</i>.</p>
<p><i>A soir&eacute;e fantastique</i>! what would I not give to be
present at a <i>soir&eacute;e fantastique</i>! I had read of the
Rosicrucians, of Count Cagliostro, and of Doctor Dee. I had peeped
into more than one curious treatise on Demonology, and I fancied
there could be nothing in the world half so marvellous as that last
surviving branch of the Black Art entitled the Science of
Legerdemain.</p>
<p>What if, for this once, I were to ask leave to be present at the
performance? Should I do so with even the remotest chance of
success? It was easier to propound this momentous question than to
answer it. My father, as I have already said, disapproved of public
entertainments, and his prejudices were tolerably inveterate. But
then, what could be more genteel than the programme, or more select
than the prices? How different was an entertainment given in the
large room of the Red Lion Hotel to a three-penny wax-work, or a
strolling circus on Barnard's Green! I had made one of the audience
in that very room over and over again when the Vicar read his
celebrated "Discourses to Youth," or Dr. Dunks came down from
Grinstead to deliver an explosive lecture on chemistry; and I had
always seen the reserved seats filled by the best families in the
neighborhood. Fully persuaded of the force of my own arguments, I
made up my mind to prefer this tremendous request on the first
favorable opportunity, and so hurried home, with my head full of
quite other thoughts than usual.</p>
<p>My father was sitting at the table with a mountain of books and
papers before him. He looked up sharply as I entered, jerked his
chair round so as to get the light at his back, put on his
spectacles, and ejaculated:--</p>
<p>"Well, sir!"</p>
<p>This was a bad sign, and one with which I was only too familiar.
Nature had intended my father for a barrister. He was an adept in
all the arts of intimidation, and would have conducted a
cross-examination to perfection. As it was, he indulged in a good
deal of amateur practice, and from the moment when he turned his
back to the light and donned the inexorable spectacles, there was
not a soul in the house, from myself down to the errand-boy, who
was not perfectly aware of something unpleasant to follow.</p>
<p>"Well, sir!" he repeated, rapping impatiently upon the table
with his knuckles.</p>
<p>Having nothing to reply to this greeting, I looked out of the
window and remained silent; whereby, unfortunately. I irritated him
still more.</p>
<p>"Confound you, sir!" he exclaimed, "have you nothing to
say?"</p>
<p>"Nothing," I replied, doggedly.</p>
<p>"Stand there!" he said, pointing to a particular square in the
pattern of the carpet. "Stand there!"</p>
<p>I obeyed.</p>
<p>"And now, perhaps, you will have the goodness to explain what
you have been about this morning; and why it should have taken you
just thirty-seven minutes by the clock to accomplish a journey
which a tortoise--yes, sir, a tortoise,--might have done in less
than ten?"</p>
<p>I gravely compared my watch with the clock before replying.</p>
<p>"Upon my word, sir," I said, "your tortoise would have the
advantage of me."</p>
<p>"The advantage of you! What do you mean by the advantage of you,
you affected puppy?"</p>
<p>"I had no idea," said I, provokingly, "that you were in unusual
haste this morning."</p>
<p>"Haste!" shouted my father. "I never said I was in haste. I
never choose to be in haste. I hate haste!"</p>
<p>"Then why..."</p>
<p>"Because you have been wasting your time and mine, sir,"
interrupted he. "Because I will not permit you to go idling and
vagabondizing about the village."</p>
<p>My <i>sang froid</i> was gone directly.</p>
<p>"Idling and vagabondizing!" I repeated angrily. "I have done
nothing of the kind. I defy you to prove it. When have you known me
forget that I am a gentleman?"</p>
<p>"Humph!" growled my father, mollified but sarcastic; "a pretty
gentleman--a gentleman of sixteen!"</p>
<p>"It is true,"' I continued, without heeding the interruption,
"that I lingered for a moment to read a placard by the way; but if
you will take the trouble, sir, to inquire at the Rectory, you will
find that I waited a quarter of an hour before I could send up your
letter."</p>
<p>My father grinned and rubbed his hands. If there was one thing
in the world that aggravated him more than another, it was to find
his fire opposed to ice. Let him, however, succeed in igniting his
adversary, and he was in a good humor directly.</p>
<p>"Come, come, Basil," said he, taking off his spectacles, "I
never said you were not a good lad. Go to your books, boy--go to
your books; and this evening I will examine you in vegetable
physiology."</p>
<p>Silently, but not sullenly, I drew a chair to the table, and
resumed my work. We were both satisfied, because each in his heart
considered himself the victor. My father was amused at having
irritated me, whereas I was content because he had, in some sort,
withdrawn the expressions that annoyed me. Hence we both became
good-tempered, and, according to our own tacit fashion, continued
during the rest of that morning to be rather more than usually
sociable.</p>
<p>Hours passed thus--hours of quiet study, during which the quick
travelling of a pen or the occasional turning of a page alone
disturbed the silence. The warm sunlight which shone in so greenly
through the vine leaves, stole, inch by inch, round the broken
vases in the garden beyond, and touched their brown mosses with a
golden bloom. The patient shadow on the antique sundial wound its
way imperceptibly from left to right, and long slanting threads of
light and shadow pierced in time between the branches of the
poplars. Our mornings were long, for we rose early and dined late;
and while my father paid professional visits, I devoted my hours to
study. It rarely happened that he could thus spend a whole day
among his books. Just as the clock struck four, however, there came
a ring at the bell.</p>
<p>My father settled himself obstinately in his chair.</p>
<p>"If that's a gratis patient," said he, between his teeth, "I'll
not stir. From eight to ten are their hours, confound them!"</p>
<p>"If you please, sir," said Mary, peeping in, "if you please,
sir, it's a gentleman."</p>
<p>"A stranger?" asked my father.</p>
<p>Mary nodded, put her hand to her mouth, and burst into an
irrepressible giggle.</p>
<p>"If you please, sir," she began--but could get no farther.</p>
<p>My father was in a towering passion directly.</p>
<p>"Is the girl mad?" he shouted. "What is the meaning of this
buffoonery?"</p>
<p>"Oh, sir--if you please, sir," ejaculated Mary, struggling with
terror and laughter together, "it's the gentleman, sir. He--he
says, if you please, sir, that his name is Almond Pudding!"</p>
<p>"Your pardon, Mademoiselle," said a plaintive voice. "Armand
Proudhine--le Chevalier Armand Proudhine, at your service."</p>
<p>Mary disappeared with her apron to her mouth, and subsided into
distant peals of laughter, leaving the Chevalier standing in the
doorway.</p>
<p>He was a very little man, with a pinched and melancholy
countenance, and an eye as wistful as a dog's. His threadbare
clothes, made in the fashion of a dozen years before, had been
decently mended in many places. A paste pin in a faded cravat, and
a jaunty cane with a pinchbeck top, betrayed that he was still
somewhat of a beau. His scant gray hair was tied behind with a
piece of black ribbon, and he carried his hat under his arm, after
the fashion of Elliston and the Prince Regent, as one sees them in
the colored prints of fifty years ago.</p>
<p>He advanced a step, bowed, and laid his card upon the table.</p>
<p>"I believe," he said in his plaintive voice, and imperfect
English, "that I have the honor to introduce myself to Monsieur
Arbuthnot."</p>
<p>"If you want me, sir," said my father, gruffly, "I am Doctor
Arbuthnot."</p>
<p>"And I, Monsieur," said the little Frenchman, laying his hand
upon his heart, and bowing again--"I am the Wizard of the
Caucasus."</p>
<p>"The what?" exclaimed my father.</p>
<p>"The Wizard of the Caucasus," replied our visitor,
impressively.</p>
<p>There was an awkward pause, during which my father looked at me
and touched his forehead significantly with his forefinger; while
the Chevalier, embarrassed between his natural timidity and his
desire to appear of importance, glanced from one face to the other,
and waited for a reply. I hastened to disentangle the
situation.</p>
<p>"I think I can explain this gentleman's meaning," I said.
"Monsieur le Chevalier will perform to-morrow evening in the large
room of the Red Lion Hotel. He is a professor of legerdemain."</p>
<p>"Of the marvellous art of legerdemain, Monsieur Arbuthnot,"
interrupted the Chevalier eagerly. "Prestidigitateur to the Court
of Sachsenhausen, and successor to Al Hakim, the wise. It is I,
Monsieur, that have invent the famous <i>tour du pistolet;</i> it
is I, that have originate the great and surprising deception of the
bottle; it is I whom the world does surname the Wizard of the
Caucasus. <i>Me voici!</i>"</p>
<p>Carried away by the force of his own eloquence, the Chevalier
fell into an attitude at the conclusion of his little speech; but
remembering where he was, blushed, and bowed again.</p>
<p>"Pshaw," said my father impatiently, "the man's a conjuror."</p>
<p>The little Frenchman did not hear him. He was at that moment
untying a packet which he carried in his hat, the contents whereof
appeared to consist of a number of very small pink and yellow
cards. Selecting a couple of each color, he deposited his hat
carefully upon the floor and came a few steps nearer to the
table.</p>
<p>"Monsieur will give me the hope to see him, with Monsieur <i>son
fils</i>, at my Soir&eacute;e Fantastique, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>" he
asked, timidly.</p>
<p>"Sir," said my father shortly, "I never encourage peripatetic
mendicity."</p>
<p>The little Frenchman looked puzzled.</p>
<p>"<i>Comment</i>?" said he, and glanced to me for an
explanation.</p>
<p>"I am very sorry, Monsieur," I interposed hastily; "but my
father objects to public entertainments."</p>
<p>"<i>Ah, mon Dieu!</i> but not to this," cried the Chevalier,
raising his hands and eyes in deprecating astonishment. "Not to my
Soir&eacute;e Fantastique! The art of legerdemain, Monsieur, is not
immoral. He is graceful--he is surprising--he is innocent; and,
Monsieur, he is patronized by the Church; he is patronized by your
amiable <i>Cur&eacute;</i>, Monsieur le Docteur Brand."</p>
<p>"Oh, father," I exclaimed, "Dr. Brand has taken tickets!"</p>
<p>"And pray, sir, what's that to me?" growled my father, without
looking up from the book which he had ungraciously resumed. "Let
Dr. Brand make a fool of himself, if he pleases. I'm not bound to
do the same."</p>
<p>The Chevalier blushed crimson--not with humility this time, but
with pride. He gathered the cards into his pocket, took up his hat,
and saying stiffly--"<i>Monsieur, je vous demande
pardon.</i>"--moved towards the door.</p>
<p>On the threshold he paused, and turning towards me with an air
of faded dignity:--"Young gentleman," he said, "<i>you</i> I thank
for your politeness."</p>
<p>He seemed as if he would have said more--hesitated--became
suddenly livid--put his hand to his head, and leaned for support
against the wall.</p>
<p>My father was up and beside him in an instant. We carried rather
than led him to the sofa, untied his cravat, and administered the
necessary restoratives. He was all but insensible for some moments.
Then the color came back to his lips, and he sighed heavily.</p>
<p>"An attack of the nerves," he said, shaking his head feebly. "An
attack of the nerves, Messieurs."</p>
<p>My father looked doubtful.</p>
<p>"Are you often taken in this way?" he asked, with unusual
gentleness.</p>
<p>"<i>Mais oui</i>, Monsieur," admitted the Frenchman,
reluctantly. "He does often arrive to me. Not--not that he is
dangerous. Ah, bah! <i>Pas du tout</i>!"</p>
<p>"Humph!" ejaculated my father, more doubtfully than before. "Let
me feel your pulse."</p>
<p>The Chevalier bowed and submitted, watching the countenance of
the operator all the time with an anxiety that was not lost upon
me.</p>
<p>"Do you sleep well?" asked my father, holding the fragile little
wrist between his finger and thumb.</p>
<p>"Passably, Monsieur."</p>
<p>"Dream much?"</p>
<p>"Ye--es, I dream."</p>
<p>"Are you subject to giddiness?"</p>
<p>The Chevalier shrugged his shoulders and looked uneasy.</p>
<p>"<i>C'est vrai</i>" he acknowledged, more unwillingly than ever,
"<i>J'ai des vertiges</i>."</p>
<p>My father relinquished his hold and scribbled a rapid
prescription.</p>
<p>"There, sir," said he, "get that preparation made up, and when
you next feel as you felt just now, drink a wine-glassful. I should
recommend you to keep some always at hand, in case of emergency.
You will find further directions on the other side."</p>
<p>The little Frenchman attempted to get up with his usual
vivacity; but was obliged to balance himself against the back of a
chair.</p>
<p>"Monsieur," said he, with another of his profound bows, "I thank
you infinitely. You make me too much attention; but I am grateful.
And, Monsieur, my little girl--my child that is far away across the
sea--she thanks you also. <i>Elle m'aime, Monsieur--elle m'aime,
cette pauvre petite</i>! What shall she do if I die?"</p>
<p>Again he raised his hand to his brow. He was unconscious of
anything theatrical in the gesture. He was in sad earnest, and his
eyes were wet with tears, which he made no effort to conceal.</p>
<p>My father shuffled restlessly in his chair.</p>
<p>"No obligation--no obligation at all," he muttered, with a touch
of impatience in his voice. "And now, what about those tickets? I
suppose, Basil, you're dying to see all this tomfoolery?"</p>
<p>"That I am, sir," said I, joyfully. "I should like it above all
things!"</p>
<p>The Chevalier glided forward, and laid a couple of little pink
cards upon my father's desk.</p>
<p>"If," said he, timidly, "if Monsieur will make me the honor to
accept...."</p>
<p>"Not for the world, sir--not for the world!" interposed my
father. "The boy shan't go, unless I pay for the tickets."</p>
<p>"But, Monsieur...."</p>
<p>"Nothing of the kind, sir. I cannot hear of it. What are the
prices of the seats?"</p>
<p>Our little visitor looked down and was silent; but I replied for
him.</p>
<p>"The reserved seats," I whispered, "are half-a-crown each."</p>
<p>"Then I will take eight reserved," said my father, opening a
drawer in his desk and bringing out a bright, new sovereign.</p>
<p>The little Frenchman started. He could hardly believe in such
munificence.</p>
<p>"When? How much?" stammered he, with a pleasant confusion of
adverbs.</p>
<p>"Eight," growled my father, scarcely able to repress a
smile.</p>
<p>"Eight? <i>mon Dieu</i>, Monsieur, how you are generous! I shall
keep for you all the first row."</p>
<p>"Oblige me by doing nothing of the kind," said my father, very
decisively. "It would displease me extremely."</p>
<p>The Chevalier counted out the eight little pink cards, and
ranged them in a row beside my father's desk.</p>
<p>"Count them, Monsieur, if you please," said he, his eyes
wandering involuntarily towards the sovereign.</p>
<p>My father did so with much gravity, and handed over the
money.</p>
<p>The Chevalier consigned it, with trembling fingers, to a small
canvas bag, which looked very empty, and which came from the
deepest recesses of his pocket.</p>
<p>"Monsieur," said he, "my thanks are in my heart. I will not
fatigue you with them. Good-morning."</p>
<p>He bowed again, for perhaps the twentieth time; lingered a
moment at the threshold; and then retired, closing the door softly
after him.</p>
<p>My father rubbbed his head all over, and gave a great yawn of
satisfaction.</p>
<p>"I am so much obliged to you, sir," I said, eagerly.</p>
<p>"What for?"</p>
<p>"For having bought those tickets. It was very kind of you."</p>
<p>"Hold your tongue. I hate to be thanked," snarled he, and
plunged back again into his books and papers.</p>
<p>Once more the studious silence in the room--once more the
rustling leaf and scratching pen, which only made the stillness
seem more still, within and without.</p>
<p>"I beg your pardons," murmured the voice of the little
Chevalier.</p>
<p>I turned, and saw him peeping through the half-open door. He
looked more wistful than ever, and twisted the handle nervously
between his fingers.</p>
<p>My father frowned, and muttered something between his teeth. I
fear it was not very complimentary to the Chevalier.</p>
<p>"One word, Monsieur," pleaded the little man, edging himself
round the door, "one small word!"</p>
<p>"Say it, sir, and have done with it," said my father,
savagely.</p>
<p>The Chevalier hesitated.</p>
<p>"I--I--Monsieur le Docteur--that is, I wish...."</p>
<p>"Confound it, sir, what do you wish?"</p>
<p>The Chevalier brushed away a tear.</p>
<p>"<i>Dites-moi,"</i> he said with suppressed agitation. "One
word--yes or no--is he dangerous?"</p>
<p>My father's countenance softened.</p>
<p>"My good friend," he said, gently, "we are none of us safe for
even a day, or an hour; but after all, that which we call danger is
merely a relative position. I have known men in a state more
precarious than yours who lived to a long old age, and I see no
reason to doubt that with good living, good spirits, and
precaution, you stand as fair a chance as another."</p>
<p>The little Frenchman pressed his hands together in token of
gratitude, whispered a broken word or two of thanks, and bowed
himself out of the room.</p>
<p>When he was fairly gone, my father flung a book at my head, and
said, with more brevity than politeness:--</p>
<p>"Boy, bolt the door."</p>

<h3>THE EVENTS OF AN EVENING.</h3>
<br>
<p>"Basil, my boy, if you are going to that place, you must take
Collins with you."</p>
<p>"Won't you go yourself, father?"</p>
<p>"I! Is the boy mad!"</p>
<p>"I hope not, sir; only as you took eight reserved seats, I
thought...."</p>
<p>"You've no business to think, sir! Seven of those tickets are in
the fire."</p>
<p>"For fear, then, you should fancy to burn the eighth, I'll wish
you good-evening!"</p>
<p>So away I darted, called to Collins to follow me, and set off at
a brisk pace towards the Red Lion Hotel. Collins was our indoor
servant; a sharp, merry fellow, some ten years older than myself,
who desired no better employment than to escort me upon such an
occasion as the present. The audience had begun to assemble when we
arrived. Collins went into the shilling places, while I ensconced
myself in the second row of reserved seats. I had an excellent view
of the stage. There, in the middle of the platform, stood the
conjuror's table--a quaint, cabalistic-looking piece of furniture
with carved black legs and a deep bordering of green cloth all
round the top. A gay pagoda-shaped canopy of many hues was erected
overhead. A long white wand leaned up against the wall. To the
right stood a bench laden with mysterious jars, glittering bowls,
gilded cones, mystical globes, colored glass boxes, and other
properties. To the left stood a large arm-chair covered with
crimson cloth. All this was very exciting, and I waited
breathlessly till the Wizard should appear.</p>
<p>He came at last; but not, surely, our dapper little visitor of
yesterday! A majestic beard of ashen gray fell in patriarchal locks
almost to his knees. Upon his head he wore a high cap of some dark
fur; upon his feet embroidered slippers; and round his waist a
glittering belt patterned with hieroglyphics. A long woollen robe
of chocolate and orange fell about him in heavy folds, and swept
behind him, like a train. I could scarcely believe, at first, that
it was the same person; but, when he spoke, despite the pomp and
obscurity of his language. I recognised the plaintive voice of the
little Chevalier.</p>
<p>"<i>Messieurs et Mesdames</i>," he began, and took up the wand
to emphasize his discourse; "to read in the stars the events of the
future--to transform into gold the metals inferior--to discover the
composition of that Elixir who, by himself, would perpetuate life,
was in past ages the aim and aspiration of the natural philosopher.
But they are gone, those days--they are displaced, those sciences.
The Alchemist and the Rosicrucian are no more, and of all their
race, the professor of Legerdemain alone survives. Ladies and
gentlemen, my magic he is simple. I retain not familiars. I employ
not crucible, nor furnace, nor retort. I but amuse you with my
agility of hand, and for commencement I tell you that you shall be
deceived as well as the Wizard of the Caucasus can deceive
you."</p>
<p>His voice trembled, and the slender wand shivered in his hand.
Was this nervousness? Or was he, in accordance with the quaintness
of his costume and the amplitude of his beard, enacting the
feebleness of age?</p>
<p>He advanced to the front of the platform. "Three things I
require," he said. "A watch, a pocket-handkerchief and a hat. Is
there here among my visitors any person so gracious as to lend me
these trifles? I will not injure them, ladies and gentlemen. I will
only pound the watch in my mortar--burn the <i>mouchoir</i> in my
lamp, and make a pudding in the <i>chapeau</i>. And, with all this,
I engage to return them to their proprietors, better as new."</p>
<p>There was a pause, and a laugh. Presently a gentleman
volunteered his hat, and a lady her embroidered handkerchief; but
no person seemed willing to submit his watch to the pounding
process.</p>
<p>"Shall nobody lend me the watch?" asked the Chevalier; but in a
voice so hoarse that I scarcely recognised it.</p>
<p>A sudden thought struck me, and I rose in my place.</p>
<p>"I shall be happy to do so," I said aloud, and made my way round
to the front of the platform.</p>
<p>At the moment when he took it from me, I spoke to him.</p>
<p>"Monsieur Proudhine," I whispered, "you are ill! What can I do
for you?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, <i>mon enfant</i>," he answered, in the same low tone.
"I suffer; <i>mais il faut se r&eacute;signer</i>."</p>
<p>"Break off the performance--retire for half an hour."</p>
<p>"Impossible. See, they already observe us!"</p>
<p>And he drew back abruptly. There was a seat vacant in the front
row. I took it, resolved at all events to watch him narrowly.</p>
<p>Not to detail too minutely the events of a performance which
since that time has become sufficiently familiar, I may say that he
carried out his programme with dreadful exactness, and, after
appearing to burn the handkerchief to ashes and mix up a quantity
of eggs and flour in the hat, proceeded very coolly to smash the
works of my watch beneath his ponderous pestle. Notwithstanding my
faith, I began to feel seriously uncomfortable. It was a neat
little silver watch of foreign workmanship--not very valuable, to
be sure, but precious to me as the most precious of repeaters.</p>
<p>"He is very tough, your watch, Monsieur," said the Wizard,
pounding away vigorously. "He--he takes a long time ... <i>Ah! mon
Dieu!</i>"</p>
<p>He raised his hand to his head, uttered a faint cry, and
snatched at the back of the chair for support.</p>
<p>My first thought was that he had destroyed my watch by
mistake--my second, that he was very ill indeed. Scarcely knowing
what I did, and quite forgetting the audience, I jumped on the
platform to his aid.</p>
<p>He shook his head, waved me away with one trembling hand, made a
last effort to articulate, and fell heavily to the ground.</p>
<p>All was confusion in an instant. Everybody crowded to the stage;
whilst I, with a presence of mind which afterwards surprised
myself, made my way out by a side-door and ran to fetch my father.
He was fortunately at home, and in less than ten minutes the
Chevalier was under his care. We found him laid upon a sofa in one
of the sitting-rooms of the inn, pale, rigid, insensible, and
surrounded by an idle crowd of lookers-on. They had taken off his
cap and beard, and the landlady was endeavoring to pour some brandy
down his throat; but his teeth were fast set, and his lips were
blue and cold.</p>
<p>"Oh, Doctor Arbuthnot! Doctor Arbuthnot!" cried a dozen voices
at once, "the Conjuror is dying!"</p>
<p>"For which reason, I suppose, you are all trying to smother
him!" said my father angrily. "Mistress Cobbe, I beg you will not
trouble yourself to pour that brandy down the man's throat. He has
no more power to swallow it than my stick. Basil, open the window,
and help me to loosen these things about his throat. Good people,
all, I must request you to leave the room. This man's life is in
peril, and I can do nothing while you remain. Go home--go home. You
will see no more conjuring to-night."</p>
<p>My father was peremptory, and the crowd unwillingly dispersed.
One by one they left the room and gathered discontentedly in the
passage. When it came to the last two or three, he took them by the
shoulders, closed the door upon them, and turned the key.</p>
<p>Only the landlady, and elderly woman-servant, and myself
remained.</p>
<p>The first thing my father did was to examine the pupil of the
patient's eye, and lay his hand upon his heart. It still fluttered
feebly, but the action of the lungs was suspended, and his hands
and feet were cold as death.</p>
<p>My father shook his head.</p>
<p>"This man must be bled," said he, "but I have little hope of
saving him."</p>
<p>He was bled, and, though still unconscious, became less rigid
They then poured a little wine down his throat, and he fell into a
passive but painless condition, more inanimate than sleep, but less
positive than a state of trance.</p>
<p>A fire was then lighted, a mattress brought down, and the
patient laid upon it, wrapped in many blankets. My father announced
his intention of sitting up with him all night. In vain I begged
for leave to share his vigil. He would hear of no such thing, but
turned me out as he had turned out the others, bade me a brief
"Good-night," and desired me to run home as quickly as I could.</p>
<p>At that stage of my history, to hear was to obey; so I took my
way quietly through the bar of the hotel, and had just reached the
door when a touch on my sleeve arrested me. It was Mr. Cobbe, the
landlord--a portly, red-whiskered Boniface of the old English
type.</p>
<p>"Good-evening, Mr. Basil," said he. "Going home, sir?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Mr. Cobbe," I replied. "I can be of no further use
here."</p>
<p>"Well, sir, you've been of more use this evening than
anybody--let alone the Doctor--that I must say for you," observed
Mr. Cobbe, approvingly. "I never see such presence o' mind in so
young a gen'leman before. Never, sir. Have a glass of grog and a
cigar, sir, before you turn out."</p>
<p>Much as I felt flattered by the supposition that I smoked (which
was more than I could have done to save my life), I declined Mr.
Cobbe's obliging offer and wished him good-night. But the landlord
of the Red Lion was in a gossiping humor, and would not let me
go.</p>
<p>"If you won't take spirits, Mr. Basil," said he, "you must have
a glass of negus. I couldn't let you go out without something
warm--particular after the excitement you've gone through. Why,
bless you, sir, when they ran out and told me, I shook like a
leaf--and I don't look like a very nervous subject, do I? And so
sudden as it was, too, poor little gentleman!"</p>
<p>"Very sudden, indeed," I replied, mechanically.</p>
<p>"Does Doctor Arbuthnot think he'll get the better of it, Mr.
Basil?"</p>
<p>"I fear he has little hope."</p>
<p>Mr. Cobbe sighed, and shook his head, and smoked in silence.</p>
<p>"To be struck down just when he was playing such tricks as them
conjuring dodges, do seem uncommon awful," said he, after a time.
"What was he after at the minute?--making a pudding, wasn't he, in
some gentleman's hat?"</p>
<p>I uttered a sudden ejaculation, and set down my glass of negus
untasted. Till that moment I had not once thought of my watch.</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr. Cobbe!" I cried, "he was pounding my watch in the
mortar!"</p>
<p>"<i>Your</i> watch, Mr. Basil?"</p>
<p>"Yes, mine--and I have not seen it since. What can have become
of it? What shall I do?"</p>
<p>"Do!" echoed the landlord, seizing a candle; "why, go and look
for it, to be sure, Mr. Basil. That's safe enough, you may be
sure!"</p>
<p>I followed him to the room where the performance had taken
place. It showed darkly and drearily by the light of one feeble
candle. The benches and chairs were all in disorder. The wand lay
where it had fallen from the hand of the Wizard. The mortar still
stood on the table, with the pestle beside it. It contained only
some fragments of broken glass.</p>
<p>Mr. Cobbe laughed triumphantly.</p>
<p>"Come, sir," said he, "the watch is safe enough, anyhow.
Mounseer only made believe to pound it up, and now all that
concerns us is to find it."</p>
<p>That was indeed all--not only all, but too much. We searched
everything. We looked in all the jars and under all the moveables.
We took the cover off the chair; we cleared the table; but without
success. My watch had totally disappeared, and we at length decided
that it must be concealed about the conjuror's person. Mr. Cobbe
was my consoling angel.</p>
<p>"Bless you, sir," said he, "don't never be cast down. My wife
shall look for the watch to-morrow morning, and I'll promise you
we'll find out every pocket he has about him."</p>
<p>"And my father--you won't tell my father?" I said,
dolefully.</p>
<p>Mr. Cobbe replied by a mute but expressive piece of pantomime
and took me back to the bar, where the good landlady ratified all
that her husband had promised in her name.</p>
<p>The stars shone brightly as I went home, and there was no moon.
The town was intensely silent, and the road intensely solitary. I
met no one on my way; let myself quietly in, and stole up to my
bed-room in the dark.</p>
<p>It was already late; but I was restless and weary--too restless
to sleep, and too weary to read. I could not detach myself from the
impressions of the day; and I longed for the morning, that I might
learn the fate of my watch, and the condition of the Chevalier.</p>
<p>At length, after some hours of wakefulness, I dropped into a
profound and dreamless sleep.</p>

<h3>THE CHEVALIER MAKES HIS LAST EXIT.</h3>
<center>All the world's a stage,<br>
And all the men and women merely players:<br>
They have their exits and their entrances.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>As You Like It.</i></center>
<br>
<p>I was waked by my father's voice calling to me from the garden,
and so started up with that strange and sudden sense of trouble
which most of us have experienced at some time or other in our
lives.</p>
<p>"Nine o'clock, Basil," cried my father. "Nine o'clock--come down
directly, sir!"</p>
<p>I sprang out of bed, and for some seconds could remember nothing
of what had happened; but when I looked out of the window and saw
my father in his dressing-gown and slippers walking up and down the
sunny path with his hands behind his back and his eyes fixed on the
ground, it all flashed suddenly upon me. To plunge into my bath,
dress, run down, and join him in the garden, was the work of but a
few minutes.</p>
<p>"Good-morning, sir," I said, breathlessly.</p>
<p>He stopped short in his walk, and looked at me from head to
foot.</p>
<p>"Humph!" said he, "you have dressed quickly...."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir; I was startled to find myself so late."</p>
<p>"So quickly," he continued, "that you have forgotten your
watch."</p>
<p>I felt my face burn. I had not a word to answer.</p>
<p>"I suppose," said he, "you thought I should not find it
out?"</p>
<p>"I had hoped to recover it first," I replied, falteringly;
"but...."</p>
<p>"But you may make up your mind to the loss of it, sir; and serve
you rightly, too," interposed my father. "I can tell you, for your
satisfaction, that the man's clothes have been thoroughly examined,
and that your watch has not been found. No doubt it lay somewhere
on the table, and was stolen in the confusion."</p>
<p>I hung my head. I could have wept for vexation.</p>
<p>My father laughed sardonically.</p>
<p>"Well, Master Basil," he said, "the loss is yours, and yours
only. You won't get another watch from me, I promise you."</p>
<p>I retorted angrily, whereat he only laughed the more; and then
we went in to breakfast.</p>
<p>Our morning meal was more unsociable than usual. I was too much
annoyed to speak, and my father too preoccupied. I longed to
inquire after the Chevalier, but not choosing to break the silence,
hurried through my breakfast that I might run round to the Red Lion
immediately after. Before we had left the table, a messenger came
to say that "the conjuror was taken worse," and so my father and I
hastened away together.</p>
<p>He had passed from his trance-like sleep into a state of
delirium, and when we entered the room was sitting up, pale and
ghost-like, muttering to himself, and gesticulating as if in the
presence of an audience.</p>
<p>"<i>Pas du tout</i>," said he fantastically, "<i>pas du tout,
Messieurs</i>--here is no deception. You shall see him pass from my
hand to the <i>coffre</i>, and yet you shall not find how he does
travel."</p>
<p>My father smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>"Conjurer to the last!" said he. "In the face of death, what a
mockery is his trade!"</p>
<p>Wandering as were his wits, he caught the last word and turned
fiercely round; but there was no recognition in his eye.</p>
<p>"Trade, Monsieur!" he echoed. "Trade!--you shall not call him
trade! Do you know who I am, that you dare call him trade? <i>Dieu
des Dieux! N'est-ce pas que je suis noble, moi?</i> Trade!--when
did one of my race embrace a trade? <i>Canaille!</i> I do
condescend for my reasons to take your money, but you shall not
call him a trade!"</p>
<p>Exhausted by this sudden burst of passion, he fell back upon his
pillow, muttering and flushed. I bent over him, and caught a
scattered phrase from time to time. He was dreaming of wealth,
fancying himself rich and powerful, poor wretch! and all
unconscious of his condition.</p>
<p>"You shall see my Chateaux," he said, "my horses--my carriages.
Listen--it is the ringing of the bells. Aha! <i>le jour viendra--le
jour viendra</i>! Conjuror! who speaks of a conjuror? I never was a
conjuror! I deny it: and he lies who says it! <i>Attendons</i>! Is
the curtain up? Ah! my table--where is my table? I cannot play till
I have my table. <i>Sc&eacute;l&eacute;rats! je suis vol&eacute;!
je l'ai perdu! je l'ai perdu</i>! Ah, what shall I do? What shall I
do? They have taken my table--they have taken...."</p>
<p>He burst into tears, moaned twice or thrice, closed his eyes,
and fell into a troubled sleep.</p>
<p>The landlady sobbed. Hers was a kind heart, and the little
Frenchman's simple courtesy had won her good-will from the
first.</p>
<p>"He had real quality manners," she said, disconsolately. "I do
believe, gentlemen, that he had seen better days. Poor as he was,
he never disputed the price of anything; and he never spoke to me
without taking off his hat."</p>
<p>"Upon my soul, Mistress Cobbe," said my father, "I incline to
your opinion. I do think he is not what he seems."</p>
<p>"And if I only knew where to find his friends, I shouldn't care
half so much!" exclaimed the landlady. "It do seem so hard that he
should die here, and not one of his own blood follow him to the
grave! Surely he has some one who loves him!"</p>
<p>"There was something said the other day about a child," mused my
father. "Have no papers or letters been found about his
person?"</p>
<p>"None at all. Why, Doctor, you were here last night when we
searched for Master Basil's watch, and you are witness that he had
nothing of the kind in his possession. As to his luggage, that's
only a carpet-bag and his conjuring things, and we looked through
them as carefully as possible."</p>
<p>The Chevalier moaned again, and tossed his arms feebly in his
sleep. "The proofs," said he. "The proofs! I can do nothing without
the proofs."</p>
<p>My father listened. The landlady shook her head.</p>
<p>"He has been going on like that ever since you left, sir," she
said pitifully; "fancying he's been robbed, and calling out about
the proofs--only ten times more violent. Then, again, he thinks he
is going to act, and asks for his table. It's wonderful how he
takes on about that trumpery table!"</p>
<p>Scarcely had she spoken the words when the Chevalier opened his
eyes, and, by a supreme effort, sat upright in his bed. The cold
dew rose upon his brow; his lips quivered; he strove to speak, and
only an inarticulate cry found utterance. My father flew to his
support.</p>
<p>"If you have anything to say," he urged earnestly, "try to say
it now!"</p>
<p>The dying man trembled convulsively, and a terrible look of
despair came into his wan face.</p>
<p>"Tell--tell" ... he gasped; but his voice failed him, and he
could get no further.</p>
<p>My father laid him gently down. There came an interval of
terrible suspense--a moment of sharp agony--a deep, deep sigh--and
then silence.</p>
<p>My father laid his hand gently upon my shoulder.</p>
<p>"It is all over," he said; "and his secret, if he had one, is in
closer keeping than ours. Come away, boy; this is no place for
you."</p>

<h3>IN MEMORIAM.</h3>
<br>
<p>The poor little Chevalier! He died and became famous.</p>
<p>Births, deaths and marriages are the great events of a country
town; the prime novelties of a country newspaper; the salt of
conversation, and the soul of gossip. An individual who furnishes
the community with one or other of these topics, is a benefactor to
his species. To be born is much; to marry is more; to die is to
confer a favor on all the old ladies of the neighborhood. They love
a christening and caudle--they rejoice in a wedding and cake--but
they prefer a funeral and black kid gloves. It is a tragedy played
off at the expense of the few for the gratification of the many--a
costly luxury, of which it is pleasanter to be the spectator than
the entertainer.</p>
<p>Occurring, therefore, at a season when the supply of news was
particularly scanty, the death of the little Chevalier was a boon
to Saxonholme. The wildest reports were bandied about, and the most
extraordinary fictions set on foot respecting his origin and
station. He was a Russian spy. He was the unfortunate son of Louis
XIV and Marie Antoinette. He was a pupil of Cagliostro, and the
husband of Mlle. Lenormand. Customers flocked to the tap of the Red
Lion as they had never flocked before, unless in election-time; and
good Mrs. Cobbe had to repeat the story of the conjuror's illness
and death till, like many other reciters, she had told it so often
that she began to forget it. As for her husband, he had enough to
do to serve the customers and take the money, to say nothing of
showing the room, which proved a vast attraction, and remained for
more than a week just as it was left on the evening of the
performance, with the table, canopy and paraphernalia of wizardom
still set out upon the platform.</p>
<p>In the midst of these things arose a momentous question--what
was the religion of the deceased, and where should he be buried? As
in the old miracle plays we find good and bad angels contending for
the souls of the dead, so on this occasion did the heads of all the
Saxonholme churches, chapels and meeting-houses contend for the
body of the little Chevalier. He was a Roman Catholic. He was a
Dissenter. He was a member of the Established Church. He must be
buried in the new Protestant Cemetery. He must lie in the
churchyard of the Ebenezer Tabernacle. He must sleep in the
far-away "God's Acre" of Father Daly's Chapel, and have a cross at
his head, and masses said for the repose of his soul. The
controversy ran high. The reverend gentlemen convoked a meeting,
quarrelled outrageously, and separated in high dudgeon without
having arrived at any conclusion.</p>
<p>Whereupon arose another question, melancholy, ludicrous,
perplexing, and, withal, as momentous as the first--Would the
little Chevalier get buried at all? Or was he destined to remain,
like Mahomet's coffin, for ever in a state of suspense?</p>
<p>At the last, when Mr. and Mrs. Cobbe despairingly believed that
they were never to be relieved of their troublesome guest, a vestry
was called, and the churchwardens brought the matter to a
conclusion. When he went round with his tickets, the conjuror
called first at the Rectory, and solicited the patronage of Doctor
Brand. Would he have paid that compliment to the cloth had he been
other than a member of that religion "by law established?"
Certainly not. The point was clear--could not be clearer; so
orthodoxy and the new Protestant Cemetery carried the day.</p>
<p>The funeral was a great event--not so far as mutes, feathers and
carriages were concerned, for the Chevalier left but little worldly
gear, and without hard cash even the most deserving must forego
"the trappings and the suits of woe;" but it was a great event,
inasmuch as it celebrated the victory of the Church, and the defeat
of all schismatics. The rector himself, complacent and dignified,
preached the funeral sermon to a crowded congregation, the
following Sunday. We almost forgot, in fact, that the little
Chevalier had any concern in the matter, and regarded it only as
the triumph of orthodoxy.</p>
<p>All was not ended, even here. For some weeks our conjuror
continued to be the hero of every pulpit round about. He was cited
as a shining light, denounced as a vessel of wrath, praised, pitied
and calumniated according to the creed and temper of each
declaimer. At length the controversy languished, died a natural
death, and became "alms for oblivion."</p>
<p>Laid to rest under a young willow, in a quiet corner, with a
plain stone at his head, the little Frenchman was himself in course
of time forgotten:--</p>

<h3>POLONIUS TO LAERTES.</h3>
<br>
<p>Years went by. I studied; outgrew my jackets; became a young
man. It was time, in short, that I walked the hospitals, and passed
my examination.</p>
<p>I had spoken to my father more than once upon the
subject--spoken earnestly and urgently, as one who felt the
necessity and justice of his appeal. But he put me off from time to
time; persisted in looking upon me as a boy long after I had become
acquainted with the penalties of the razor; and counselled me to be
patient, till patience was well-nigh exhausted. The result of this
treatment was that I became miserable and discontented; spent whole
days wandering about the woods; and degenerated into a creature
half idler and half misanthrope. I had never loved the profession
of medicine. I should never have chosen it had I been free to
follow my own inclinations: but having diligently fitted myself to
enter it with credit, I felt that my father wronged me in this
delay; and I felt it perhaps all the more bitterly because my labor
had been none of love. Happily for me, however, he saw his error
before it was too late, and repaired it generously.</p>
<p>"Basil," said he, beckoning me one morning into the
consulting-room, "I want to speak to you."</p>
<p>I obeyed sullenly, and stood leaning up against the window, with
my hands in my pockets.</p>
<p>"You've been worrying me, Basil, more than enough these last few
months," he said, rummaging among his papers, and speaking in a
low, constrained voice. "I don't choose to be worried any longer.
It is time you walked the hospitals, and--you may go."</p>
<p>"To London, sir?"</p>
<p>"No. I don't intend you to go to London."</p>
<p>"To Edinburgh, then, I suppose," said I, in a tone of
disappointment.</p>
<p>"Nor to Edinburgh. You shall go to Paris."</p>
<p>"To Paris!"</p>
<p>"Yes--the French surgeons are the most skilful in the world, and
Ch&eacute;ron will do everything for you. I know no eminent man in
London from whom I should choose to ask a favor; and Ch&eacute;ron
is one of my oldest friends--nay, the oldest friend I have in the
world. If you have but two ounces of brains, he will make a clever
man of you. Under him you will study French practice; walk the
hospitals of Paris; acquire the language and, I hope, some of the
polish of the French people. Are you satisfied?"</p>
<p>"More than satisfied, sir," I replied, eagerly.</p>
<p>"You shall not want for money, boy; and you may start as soon as
you please. Is the thing settled?"</p>
<p>"Quite, as far as I am concerned."</p>
<p>My father rubbed his head all over with both hands, took off his
spectacles, and walked up and down the room. By these signs he
expressed any unusual degree of satisfaction. All at once he
stopped, looked me full in the face, and said:--</p>
<p>"Understand me, Basil. I require one thing in return."</p>
<p>"If that thing be industry, sir, I think I may promise that you
shall not have cause to complain,"</p>
<p>My father shook his head.</p>
<p>"Not industry," he said; "not industry alone. Keep good company,
my boy. Keep good hours. Never forget that a gentleman must look
like a gentleman, dress like a gentleman, frequent the society of
gentlemen. To be a mere bookworm is to be a drone in the great
hive. I hate a drone--as I hate a sloven."</p>
<p>"I understand you, father," I faltered, blushing. "I know that
of late I--I have not...."</p>
<p>My father laid his hand suddenly over my mouth.</p>
<p>"No confessions--no apologies," he said hastily. "We have both
been to blame in more respects than one, and we shall both know how
to be wiser in the future. Now go, and consider all that you may
require for your journey."</p>
<p>Agitated, delighted, full of hope, I ran up to my own room,
locked the door, and indulged in a delightful reverie. What a
prospect had suddenly opened before me! What novelty! what
adventure! To have visited London would have been to fulfil all my
desires; but to be sent to Paris was to receive a passport for
Fairyland!</p>
<p>That day, for the first time in many months, I dressed myself
carefully, and went down to dinner with a light heart, a cheerful
face, and an unexceptionable neckcloth.</p>
<p>As I took my place at the table, my father looked up cheerily
and gave me a pleased nod of recognition.</p>
<p>Our meal passed off very silently. It was my father's maxim that
no man could do more than one thing well at a time--especially at
table; so we had contracted a habit which to strangers would have
seemed even more unsociable than it really was, and gave to all our
meals an air more penitential than convivial. But this day was, in
reality, a festive occasion, and my father was disposed to be more
than usually agreeable. When the cloth was removed, he flung the
cellar-key at my head, and exclaimed, in a burst of unexampled
good-humor:--</p>
<p>"Basil, you dog, fetch up a bottle of the particular port!"</p>
<p>Now it is one of my theories that a man's after-dinner talk
takes much of its weight, color, and variety from the quality of
his wines. A generous vintage brings out generous sentiments. Good
fellowship, hospitality, liberal politics, and the milk of human
kindness, may be uncorked simultaneously with a bottle of old
Madeira; while a pint of thin Sauterne is productive only of envy,
hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness. We grow sententious on
Burgundy--logical on Bordeaux--sentimental on Cyprus--maudlin on
Lagrima Christi--and witty on Champagne.</p>
<p>Port was my father's favorite wine. It warmed his heart, cooled
his temper, and made him not only conversational, but expansive.
Leaning back complacently in his easy-chair, with the glass upheld
between his eye and the window, he discoursed to me of my journey,
of my prospects in life, and of all that I should do and avoid,
professionally and morally.</p>
<p>"Work," he said, "is the panacea for every sorrow--the plaster
for every pain--your only universal remedy. Industry, air, and
exercise are our best physicians. Trust to them, boy; but beware
how you publish the prescription, lest you find your occupation
gone. Remember, if you wish to be rich, you must never seem to be
poor; and as soon as you stand in need of your friends, you will
find yourself with none left. Be discreet of speech, and cultivate
the art of silence. Above all things, be truthful. Hold your tongue
as long as you please, but never open your lips to a lie. Show no
man the contents of your purse--he would either despise you for
having so little, or try to relieve you of the burden of carrying
so much. Above all, never get into debt, and never fall in love.
The first is disgrace, and the last is the devil! Respect yourself,
if you wish others to respect you; and bear in mind that the world
takes you at your own estimate. To dress well is a duty one owes to
society. The man who neglects his own appearance not only degrades
himself to the level of his inferiors, but puts an affront upon his
friends and acquaintances."</p>
<p>"I trust, sir," I said in some confusion, "that I shall never
incur the last reproach again."</p>
<p>"I hope not, Basil," replied my father, with a smile. "I hope
not. Keep your conscience clean and your boots blacked, and I have
no fear of you. You are no hero, my boy, but it depends upon
yourself whether you become a man of honor or a scamp; a gentleman
or a clown. You have, I see, registered a good resolution to-day.
Keep it; and remember that Pandemonium will get paved without your
help. There would be no industry, boy, if there was no idleness,
and all true progress begins with--Reform."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII."></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h3>AT THE CHEVAL BLANC</h3>
<br>
<p>My journey, even at this distance of time, appears to me like an
enchanted dream. I observed, yet scarcely remembered, the scenes
through which I passed, so divided was I between the novelty of
travelling and the eagerness of anticipation. Provided with my
letters of introduction, the sum of one hundred guineas, English,
and the enthusiasm of twenty years of age, I fancied myself endowed
with an immortality of wealth and happiness.</p>
<p>The Brighton coach passed through our town once a week; so I
started for Paris without having ever visited London, and took the
route by Newhaven and Dieppe. Having left home on Tuesday morning,
I reached Rouen in the course of the next day but one. At Rouen I
stayed to dine and sleep, and so made my way to the <i>Cheval
Blanc</i>, a grand hotel on the quay, where I was received by an
aristocratic elderly waiter who sauntered out from a side office,
surveyed me patronizingly, entered my name upon a card for a seat
at the <i>table d'hote</i>, and, having rung a feeble little bell,
sank exhausted upon a seat in the hall.</p>
<p>"To number seventeen, Marie," said this majestic personage,
handing me over to a pretty little chambermaid who attended the
summons. "And, Marie, on thy return, my child, bring me an
absinthe."</p>
<p>We left this gentleman in a condition of ostentatious languor,
and Marie deposited me in a pretty room overlooking an exquisite
little garden set round with beds of verbena and scarlet geranium,
with a fountain sparkling in the midst. This garden was planted in
what had once been the courtyard, of the building. The trees nodded
and whispered, and the windows at the opposite side of the
quadrangle glittered like burnished gold in the sunlight. I threw
open the jalousies, plucked one of the white roses that clustered
outside, and drank in with delight the sunny perfumed air that
played among the leaves, and scattered the waters of the fountain.
I could not long rest thus, however. I longed to be out and about;
so, as it was now no more than half-past three o'clock, and two
good hours of the glorious midsummer afternoon yet remained to me
before the hotel dinner-hour, I took my hat, and went out along the
quays and streets of this beautiful and ancient Norman city.</p>
<p>Under the crumbling archways; through narrow alleys where the
upper stories nearly met overhead, leaving only a bright strip of
dazzling sky between; past quaint old mansions, and sculptured
fountains, and stately churches hidden away in all kinds of strange
forgotten nooks and corners, I wandered, wondering and unwearied. I
saw the statue of Jeanne d'Arc; the ch&acirc;teau of Diane de
Poitiers; the archway carved in oak where the founder of the city
still, in rude effigy, presides; the museum rich in medi&aelig;val
relics; the market-place crowded with fruit-sellers and
flower-girls in their high Norman caps. Above all, I saw the rare
old Gothic Cathedral, with its wondrous wealth of antique
sculpture; its iron spire, destined, despite its traceried beauty,
to everlasting incompleteness; its grass-grown buttresses, and
crumbling pinnacles, and portals crowded with images of saints and
kings. I went in. All was gray, shadowy, vast; dusk with the rich
gloom of painted windows; and so silent that I scarcely dared
disturb the echoes by my footsteps. There stood in a corner near
the door a triangular iron stand stuck full of votive tapers that
flickered and sputtered and guttered dismally, shedding showers of
penitential grease-drops on the paved floor below; and there was a
very old peasant woman on her knees before the altar. I sat down on
a stone bench and fell into a long study of the stained oriel, the
light o'erarching roof, and the long perspective of the pillared
aisles. Presently the verger came out of the vestry-room, followed
by two gentlemen. He was short and plump, with a loose black gown,
slender black legs, and a pointed nose--like a larger species of
raven.</p>
<p>"<i>Bon jour, M'sieur</i>" croaked he, laying his head a little
on one side, and surveying me with one glittering eye. "Will
M'sieur be pleased to see the treasury?"</p>
<p>"The treasury!" I repeated. "What is there to be seen in the
treasury?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, sir, worth one son of an Englishman's money," said the
taller of the gentlemen. "Tinsel, paste, and dusty bones--all
humbug and extortion."</p>
<p>Something in the scornful accent and the deep voice aroused the
suspicions of the verger, though the words were spoken in
English.</p>
<p>"Our treasury, M'sieur," croaked he, more ravenly than ever, "is
rich--rich in episcopal jewels; in relics--inestimable relics.
Tickets two francs each."</p>
<p>Grateful, however, for the timely caution, I acknowledged my
countryman's courtesy by a bow, declined the proffered investment,
and went out again into the sunny streets.</p>
<p>At five o'clock I found myself installed near the head of an
immensely long dinner-table in the <i>salle &agrave; manger</i> of
the Cheval Blanc. The <i>salle &agrave; manger</i> was a
magnificent temple radiant with mirrors, and lustres, and panels
painted in fresco. The dinner was an imposing rite, served with
solemn ceremonies by ministering waiters. There were about thirty
guests seated round, in august silence, most of them very smartly
dressed, and nearly all English. A stout gentleman, with a little
knob on the top of his bald head, a buff waistcoat, and a shirt
amply frilled, sat opposite to me, flanked on either side by an
elderly daughter in green silk. On my left I was supported by a
thin young gentleman with fair hair, and blue glasses. To my right
stood a vacant chair, the occupant of which had not yet arrived;
and at the head of the table sat a spare pale man dressed all in
black, who spoke to no one, kept his eyes fixed upon his plate, and
was served by the waiters with especial servility. The soup came
and went in profound silence. Faint whispers passed to and fro with
the fish. It was not till the roast made its appearance that
anything like conversation broke the sacred silence of the meal. At
this point the owner of the vacant chair arrived, and took his
place beside me. I recognised him immediately. It was the
Englishman whom I had met in the Cathedral. We bowed, and presently
he spoke to me. In the meantime, he had every forgone item of the
dinner served to him as exactly as if he had not been late at
table, and sipped his soup with perfect deliberation while others
were busy with the sweets. Our conversation began, of course, with
the weather and the place.</p>
<p>"Your first visit to Rouen, I suppose?" said he. "Beautiful old
city, is it not? <i>Gar&ccedil;on</i>, a pint of
Bordeaux-Leoville."</p>
<p>I modestly admitted that it was not only my first visit to
Rouen, but my first to the Continent.</p>
<p>"Ah, you may go farther than Rouen, and fare worse," said he.
"Do you sketch? No? That's a pity, for it's deliciously
picturesque--though, for my own part, I am not enthusiastic about
gutters and gables, and I object to a population composed
exclusively of old women. I'm glad, by the way, that I preserved
you from wasting your time among the atrocious lumber of that
so-called treasury."</p>
<p>"The treasury!" exclaimed my slim neighbor with the blue
glasses. "Beg your p--p--pardon, sir, but are you speaking of the
Cathedral treasury? Is it worth v--v--visiting?"</p>
<p>"Singularly so," replied he to my right. "One of the rarest
collections of authentic curiosities in France. They have the
snuff-box of Clovis, the great toe of Saint Helena, and the tongs
with which St. Dunstan took the devil by the nose."</p>
<p>"Up--p--pon my word, now, that's curious," ejaculated the thin
tourist, who had an impediment in his speech. "I must p--p--put
that down. Dear me! the snuff-box of King Clovis! I must see these
relics to-morrow."</p>
<p>"Be sure you ask for the great toe of St. Helena," said my right
hand companion, proceeding imperturbably with his dinner. "The
saint had but one leg at the period of her martyrdom, and that
great toe is unique."</p>
<p>"G--g--good gracious!" exclaimed the tourist, pulling out a
gigantic note-book, and entering the fact upon the spot. "A saint
with one leg--and a lady, too! Wouldn't m--m--miss that for the
world!"</p>
<p>I looked round, puzzled by the gravity of my new
acquaintance.</p>
<p>"Is this all true?" I whispered. "You told me the treasury was a
humbug."</p>
<p>"And so it is."</p>
<p>"But the snuff-box of Clovis, and...."</p>
<p>"Pure inventions! The man's a muff, and on muffs I have no
mercy. Do you stay long in Rouen?"</p>
<p>"No, I go on to Paris to-morrow. I wish I could remain
longer."</p>
<p>"I am not sure that you would gain more from a long visit than
from a short one. Some places are like some women, charming, <i>en
passant</i>, but intolerable upon close acquaintance. It is just so
with Rouen. The place contains no fine galleries, and no places of
public entertainment; and though exquisitely picturesque, is
nothing more. One cannot always be looking at old houses, and
admiring old churches. You will be delighted with Paris."</p>
<p>"B--b--beautiful city," interposed the stammerer, eager to join
our conversation, whenever he could catch a word of it. "I'm going
to P--P--Paris myself."</p>
<p>"Then, sir, I don't doubt you will do ample justice to its
attractions," observed my right-hand neighbor. "From the size of
your note-book, and the industry with which you accumulate useful
information, I should presume that you are a conscientious observer
of all that is recondite and curious."</p>
<p>"I as--p--pire to be so," replied the other, with a blush and a
bow. "I m--m--mean to exhaust P--P--Paris. I'm going to write a
b--b--book about it, when I get home."'</p>
<p>My friend to the right flashed one glance of silent scorn upon
the future author, drained the last glass of his Bordeaux-Leoville,
pushed his chair impatiently back, and said:--"This place smells
like a kitchen. Will you come out, and have a cigar?"</p>
<p>So we rose, took our hats, and in a few moments were strolling
under the lindens on the Quai de Corneille.</p>
<p>I, of course, had never smoked in my life; and, humiliating
though it was, found myself obliged to decline a "prime Havana,"
proffered in the daintiest of embroidered cigar-cases. My companion
looked as if he pitied me. "You'll soon learn," said he. "A man
can't live in Paris without tobacco. Do you stay there many
weeks?"</p>
<p>"Two years, at least," I replied, registering an inward
resolution to conquer the difficulties of tobacco without delay. "I
am going to study medicine under an eminent French surgeon."</p>
<p>"Indeed! Well, you could not go to a better school, or embrace a
nobler profession. I used to think a soldier's life the grandest
under heaven; but curing is a finer thing than killing, after all!
What a delicious evening, is it not? If one were only in Paris,
now, or Vienna,...."</p>
<p>"What, Oscar Dalrymple!" exclaimed a voice close beside us. "I
should as soon have expected to meet the great Panjandrum
himself!"</p>
<p>"--With the little round button at top," added my companion,
tossing away the end of his cigar, and shaking hands heartily with
the new-comer. "By Jove, Frank, I'm glad to see you! What brings
you here?"</p>
<p>"Business--confound it! And not pleasant business either. <i>A
proc&eacute;s</i> which my father has instituted against a great
manufacturing firm here at Rouen, and of which I have to bear the
brunt. And you?"</p>
<p>"And I, my dear fellow? Pshaw! what should I be but an idler in
search of amusement?"</p>
<p>"Is it true that you have sold out of the Enniskillens?"</p>
<p>"Unquestionably. Liberty is sweet; and who cares to carry a
sword in time of peace? Not I, at all events."</p>
<p>While this brief greeting was going forward, I hung somewhat in
the rear, and amused myself by comparing the speakers. The
new-comer was rather below than above the middle height,
fair-haired and boyish, with a smile full of mirth and an eye full
of mischief. He looked about two years my senior. The other was
much older--two or three and thirty, at the least--dark, tall,
powerful, finely built; his wavy hair clipped close about his
sun-burnt neck; a thick moustache of unusual length; and a chest
that looked as if it would have withstood the shock of a
battering-ram. Without being at all handsome, there was a look of
brightness, and boldness, and gallantry about him that arrested
one's attention at first sight. I think I should have taken him for
a soldier, had I not already gathered it from the last words of
their conversation.</p>
<p>"Who is your friend?" I heard the new-comer whisper.</p>
<p>To which the other replied:--"Haven't the ghost of an idea."</p>
<p>Presently he took out his pocket-book, and handing me a card,
said:--</p>
<p>"We are under the mutual disadvantage of all chance
acquaintances. My name is Dalrymple--Oscar Dalrymple, late of the
Enniskillen Dragoons. My friend here is unknown to fame as Mr.
Frank Sullivan; a young gentleman who has the good fortune to be
younger partner in a firm of merchant princes, and the bad taste to
dislike his occupation."</p>
<p>How I blushed as I took Captain Dalrymple's card, and stammered
out my own name in return! I had never possessed a card in my life,
nor needed one, till this moment. I rather think that Captain
Dalrymple guessed these facts, for he shook hands with me at once,
and put an end to my embarrassment by proposing that we should take
a boat, and pull a mile or two up the river. The thing was no
sooner said than done. There were plenty of boats below the iron
bridge; so we chose one of the cleanest, and jumped into it without
any kind of reference to the owner, whoever he might be.</p>
<p>"<i>Batelier, Messieurs? Batelier</i>?" cried a dozen men at
once, rushing down to the water's edge.</p>
<p>But Dalrymple had already thrown off his coat, and seized the
oars.</p>
<p>"<i>Batelier</i>, indeed!" laughed he, as with two or three
powerful strokes he carried us right into the middle, of the
stream. "Trust an Oxford man for employing any arms but his own,
when a pair of sculls are in question!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII."></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h3>THE ISLAND IN THE RIVER.</h3>
<br>
<p>It was just eight o'clock when we started, with the twilight
coming on. Our course lay up the river, with a strong current
setting against us; so we made but little way, and enjoyed the
tranquil beauty of the evening. The sky was pale and clear,
somewhat greenish overhead and deepening along the line of the
horizon into amber and rose. Behind us lay the town with every
brown spire articulated against the sky and every vane glittering
in the last glow that streamed up from the west. To our left rose a
line of steep chalk cliffs, and before us lay the river, winding
away through meadow lands fringed with willows and poplars, and
interspersed with green islands wooded to the water's edge.
Presently the last flush faded, and one large planet, splendid and
solitary, like the first poet of a dark century, emerged from the
deepening gray.</p>
<p>My companions were in high spirits. They jested; they laughed;
they hummed scraps of songs; they had a greeting for every boat
that passed. By-and-by, we came to an island with a little
landing-place where a score or two of boats were moored against the
alders by the water's edge. A tall flag-staff gay with streamers
peeped above the tree-tops, and a cheerful sound of piping and
fiddling, mingled with the hum of many voices, came and went with
the passing breeze. As Dalrymple rested on his oars to listen, a
boat which we had outstripped some minutes before, shot past us to
the landing-place, and its occupants, five in number, alighted.</p>
<p>"Bet you ten to one that's a bridal party," said Mr.
Sullivan.</p>
<p>"Say you so? Then suppose we follow, and have a look at the
bride!" exclaimed his friend. "The place is a public garden."</p>
<p>The proposition was carried unanimously, and we landed, having
first tied the boat to a willow. We found the island laid out very
prettily; intersected by numbers of little paths, with rustic seats
here and there among the trees, and variegated lamps gleaming out
amid the grass, like parti-colored glow-worms. Following one of
these paths, we came presently to an open space, brilliantly
lighted and crowded by holiday-makers. Here were refreshment
stalls, and Russian swings, and queer-looking merry-go-rounds,
where each individual sat on a wooden horse and went gravely round
and round with a stick in his hand, trying to knock off a ring from
the top of a pole in the middle. Here, also, was a band in a gaily
decorated orchestra; a circular area roped off for dancers; a
mysterious tent with a fortune-teller inside; a lottery-stall
resplendent with vases and knick-knacks, which nobody was ever
known to win; in short, all kinds of attractions, stale enough, no
doubt, to my companions, but sufficiently novel and amusing to
me.</p>
<p>We strolled about for some time among the stalls and promenaders
and amused ourselves by criticising the company, which was composed
almost entirely of peasants, soldiers, artisans in blue blouses and
humble tradespeople. The younger women were mostly handsome, with
high Norman caps, white kerchiefs and massive gold ear-rings. Many,
in addition to the ear-rings, wore a gold cross suspended round the
neck by a piece of black velvet; and some had a brooch to match.
Here, sitting round a table under a tree, we came upon a family
group, consisting of a little plump, bald-headed <i>bourgeois</i>
with his wife and two children--the wife stout and rosy; the
children noisy and authoritative. They were discussing a dish of
poached eggs and a bottle of red wine, to the music of a polka
close by.</p>
<p>"I should like to dance," said the little girl, drumming with
her feet against the leg of the table, and eating an egg with her
fingers. "I may dance presently with Phillippe, may I not,
papa?"</p>
<p>"I won't dance," said Phillippe sulkily. "I want some
oysters."</p>
<p>"Oysters, <i>mon enfant</i>! I have told you twice already that
no one eats oysters in July," observed his mother.</p>
<p>"I don't care for that," said Phillippe. "It's my
<i>f&ecirc;te</i> day, and Uncle Jacques said I was to have
whatever I fancied; I want some oysters."</p>
<p>"Your Uncle Jacques did not know what an unreasonable boy you
are," replied the father angrily. "If you say another word about
oysters, you shall not ride in the <i>man&egrave;ge</i>
to-night."</p>
<p>Phillippe thrust his fists into his eyes and began to roar--so
we walked away.</p>
<p>In an arbor, a little further on, we saw two young people
whispering earnestly, and conscious of no eyes but each
other's.</p>
<p>"A pair of lovers," said Sullivan.</p>
<p>"And a pair that seldom get the chance of meeting, if we may
judge by their untasted omelette," replied Dalrymple. "But where's
the bridal party?"</p>
<p>"Oh, we shall find them presently. You seem interested."</p>
<p>"I am. I mean to dance with the bride and make the bridegroom
jealous."</p>
<p>We laughed and passed on, peeping into every arbor, observing
every group, and turning to stare at every pretty girl we met. My
own aptitude in the acquisition of these arts of gallantry
astonished myself. Now, we passed a couple of soldiers playing at
dominoes; now a noisy party round a table in the open air covered
with bottles; now an arbor where half a dozen young men and three
or four girls were assembled round a bowl of blazing punch. The
girls were protesting they dare not drink it, but were drinking it,
nevertheless, with exceeding gusto.</p>
<p>"Grisettes and <i>commis voyageurs!</i>" said Dalrymple,
contemptuously. "Let us go and look at the dancers."</p>
<p>We went on, and stood in the shelter of some trees near the
orchestra. The players consisted of three violins, a clarionette
and a big drum. The big drum was an enthusiastic performer. He
belabored his instrument as heartily as if it had been his worst
enemy, but with so much independence of character that he never
kept the same time as his fellow-players for two minutes together.
They were playing a polka for the benefit of some twelve or fifteen
couples, who were dancing with all their might in the space before
the orchestra. On they came, round and round and never weary, two
at a time--a mechanic and a grisette, a rustic and a Normandy girl,
a tall soldier and a short widow, a fat tradesman and his wife, a
couple of milliners assistants who preferred dancing together to
not dancing at all, and so forth.</p>
<p>"How I wish somebody would ask me, <i>ma m&egrave;re</i>!" said
a coquettish brunette, close by, with a sidelong glance at
ourselves."</p>
<p>"You shall dance with your brother Paul, my dear, as soon as he
comes," replied her mother, a stout <i>bourgeoise</i> with a green
fan.</p>
<p>"But it is such dull work to dance with one's brother!" pouted
the brunette. "If it were one's cousin, even, it would be
different."</p>
<p>Mr. Frank Sullivan flung away his cigar, and began buttoning up
his gloves.</p>
<p>"I'll take that damsel out immediately," said he. "A girl who
objects to dance with her brother deserves encouragement."</p>
<p>So away he went with his hat inclining jauntily on one side,
and, having obtained the mother's permission, whirled away with the
pretty brunette into the very thickest of the throng.</p>
<p>"There they are!" said Dalrymple, suddenly. "There's the wedding
party. <i>Per Bacco</i>! but our little bride is charming!"</p>
<p>"And the bridegroom is a handsome specimen of rusticity."</p>
<p>"Yes--a genuine pastoral pair, like a Dresden china shepherd and
shepherdess. See, the girl is looking up in his face--he shakes his
head. She is urging him to dance, and he refuses! Never mind, <i>ma
belle</i>--you shall have your valse, and Corydon may be as cross
as he pleases!"</p>
<p>"Don't flatter yourself that she will displease Corydon to dance
with your lordship!" I said, laughingly.</p>
<p>"Pshaw! she would displease fifty Corydons if I chose to make
her do so," said Dalrymple, with a smile of conscious power.</p>
<p>"True; but not on her wedding-day."</p>
<p>"Wedding-day or not, I beg to observe that in less than half an
hour you will see me whirling along with my arm round little
Phillis's dainty waist. Now come and see how I do it."</p>
<p>He made his way through the crowd, and I, half curious, half
abashed, went with him. The party was five in number, consisting of
the bride and bridegroom, a rosy, middle-aged peasant woman,
evidently the mother of the bride, and an elderly couple who looked
like humble townsfolk, and were probably related to one or other of
the newly-married pair. Dalrymple opened the attack by stumbling
against the mother, and then overwhelming her with elaborate
apologies.</p>
<p>"In these crowded places, Madame," said he, in his fluent
French, "one is scarcely responsible for an impoliteness. I beg ten
thousand pardons, however. I hope I have not hurt you?"</p>
<p>"<i>Ma foi!</i> no, M'sieur. It would take more than that to
hurt me!"</p>
<p>"Nor injured your dress, I trust, Madame?"</p>
<p>"<i>Ah, par exemple</i>! do I wear muslins or gauzes that they
should not bear touching? No, no, no, M'sieur--thanking you all the
same."</p>
<p>"You are very amiable, Madame, to say so."</p>
<p>"You are very polite, M'sieur, to think so much of a
trifle."</p>
<p>"Nothing is a trifle, Madame, where a lady is concerned. At
least, so we Englishmen consider."</p>
<p>"Bah! M'sieur is not English?"</p>
<p>"Indeed, Madame, I am."</p>
<p>"<i>Mais, mon Dieu! c'est incroyable</i>. Suzette--brother
Jacques--Andr&eacute;, do you hear this? M'sieur, here, swears that
he is English, and yet he speaks French like one of ourselves! Ah,
what a fine thing learning is!"</p>
<p>"I may say with truth, Madame, that I never appreciate the
advantages of education so highly, as when they enable me to
converse with ladies who are not my own countrywomen," said
Dalrymple, carrying on the conversation with as much studied
politeness as if his interlocutor had been a duchess. "But--excuse
the observation--you are here, I imagine, upon a happy
occasion?"</p>
<p>The mother laughed, and rubbed her hands.</p>
<p>"<i>D&acirc;me</i>! one may see that," replied she, "with one's
eyes shut! Yes, M'sieur,--yes--their wedding-day, the dear
children--their wedding-day! They've been betrothed these two
years."</p>
<p>"The bride is very like you, Madame," said Dalrymple, gravely.
"Your younger sister, I presume?"</p>
<p>"<i>Ah, quel farceur</i>! He takes my daughter for my sister!
Suzette, do you hear this? M'sieur is killing me with
laughter!"</p>
<p>And the good lady chuckled, and gasped, and wiped her eyes, and
dealt Dalrymple a playful push between the shoulders, which would
have upset the balance of any less heavy dragoon.</p>
<p>"Your daughter, Madame!" said he. "Allow me to congratulate you.
May I also be permitted to congratulate the bride?" And with this
he took off his hat to Suzette and shook hands with Andr&eacute;,
who looked not overpleased, and proceeded to introduce me as his
friend Monsieur Basil Arbuthnot, "a young English gentleman,
<i>tr&egrave;s distingu&eacute;</i>"</p>
<p>The old lady then said her name was Madame Roquet, and that she
rented a small farm about a mile and a half from Rouen; that
Suzette was her only child; and that she had lost her "blessed man"
about eight years ago. She next introduced the elderly couple as
her brother Jacques Robineau and his wife, and informed us that
Jacques was a tailor, and had a shop opposite the church of St.
Maclou, "<i>l&agrave; bas</i>."</p>
<p>To judge of Monsieur Robineau's skill by his outward appearance,
I should have said that he was professionally unsuccessful, and
supplied his own wardrobe from the misfits returned by his
customers. He wore a waistcoat which was considerably too long for
him, trousers which were considerably too short, and a green cloth
coat with a high velvet collar which came up nearly to the tops of
his ears. In respect of personal characteristics, Monsieur Robineau
and his wife were the most admirable contrast imaginable. Monsieur
Robineau was short; Madame Robineau was tall. Monsieur Robineau was
as plump and rosy as a robin; Madame Robineau was pale and bony to
behold. Monsieur Robineau looked the soul of good nature, ready to
chirrup over his <i>grog-au-vin,</i> to smoke a pipe with his
neighbor, to cut a harmless joke or enjoy a harmless frolic, as
cheerfully as any little tailor that ever lived; Madame Robineau,
on the contrary, preserved a dreadful dignity, and looked as if she
could laugh at nothing on this side of the grave. Not to consider
the question too curiously, I should have said, at first sight,
that Monsieur Robineau stood in no little awe of his wife, and that
Madame Robineau was the very head and front of their domestic
establishment.</p>
<p>It was wonderful and delightful to see how Captain Dalrymple
placed himself on the best of terms with all these good people--how
he patted Robineau on the back and complimented Madame, banished
the cloud from Andr&eacute;'s brow, and summoned a smile to the
pretty cheek of Suzette. One would have thought he had known them
for years already, so thoroughly was he at home with every member
of the wedding party.</p>
<p>Presently, he asked Suzette to dance. She blushed scarlet, and
cast a pretty appealing look at her husband and her mother. I could
almost guess what she whispered to the former by the motion of her
lips.</p>
<p>"Monsieur Andr&eacute; will, I am sure, spare Madame for one
gallop," said Dalrymple, with that kind of courtesy which accepts
no denial. It was quite another tone, quite another manner. It was
no longer the persuasive suavity of one who is desirous only to
please, but the politeness of a gentleman to au inferior.</p>
<p>The cloud came back upon Andr&eacute;'s brow, and he hesitated;
but Madame Roquet interposed.</p>
<p>"Spare her!" she exclaimed. "<i>D&acirc;me</i>! I should think
so! She has never left his arm all day. Here, my child, give me
your shawl while you dance, and bake care not to get too warm, for
the evening air is dangerous."</p>
<p>And so Suzette took off her shawl, and Andr&eacute; was
silenced, and Dalrymple, in less than the half hour, was actually
whirling away with his arm round little Phillis's dainty waist.</p>
<p>I am afraid that I proved a very indifferent <i>locum tenens</i>
for my brilliant friend, and that the good people thought me
exceedingly stupid. I tried to talk to them, but the language
tripped me up at every turn, and the right words never would come
when they were wanted. Besides, I felt uneasy without knowing
exactly why. I could not keep from watching Dalrymple and Suzette.
I could not help noticing how closely he held her; how he never
ceased talking to her; and how the smiles and blushes chased each
other over her pretty face. That I should have wit enough to
observe these things proved that my education was progressing
rapidly; but then, to be sure, I was studying under an accomplished
teacher.</p>
<p>They danced for a long time. So long, that Andr&eacute; became
uneasy, and my available French was quite exhausted. I was heartily
glad when Dalrymple brought back the little bride at last, flushed
and panting, and (himself as cool as a diplomatist) assisted her
with her shawl and resigned her to the protection of her
husband.</p>
<p>"Why hast thou danced so long with that big Englishman?"
murmured Andr&eacute;, discontentedly. "When <i>I</i> asked thee,
thou wast too tired, and now...."</p>
<p>"And now I am so happy to be near thee again," whispered
Suzette.</p>
<p>Andr&eacute; softened directly.</p>
<p>"But to dance for twenty minutes...." began he.</p>
<p>"Ah, but he danced so well, and I am so fond of waltzing,
Andr&eacute;!"</p>
<p>The cloud gathered again, and an impatient reply was coming,
when Dalrymple opportunely invited the whole party to a bowl of
punch in an adjoining arbor, and himself led the way with Madame
Roquet. The arbor was vacant, a waiter was placing the chairs, and
the punch was blazing in the bowl. It had evidently been ordered
during one of the pauses in the dance, that it might be ready to
the moment--a little attention which called forth exclamations of
pleasure from both Madame Roquet and Monsieur Robineau, and touched
with something like a gleam of satisfaction even the grim visage of
Monsieur Robineau's wife.</p>
<p>Dalrymple took the head of the table, and stirred the punch into
leaping tongues of blue flame till it looked like a miniature
Vesuvius.</p>
<p>"What diabolical-looking stuff!" I exclaimed. "You might, to all
appearance, be Lucifer's own cupbearer."</p>
<p>"A proof that it ought to be devilish good," replied Dalrymple,
ladling it out into the glasses. "Allow me, ladies and gentlemen,
to propose the health, happiness, and prosperity of the bride and
bridegroom. May they never die, and may they be remembered for ever
after!"</p>
<p>We all laughed as if this was the best joke we had heard in our
lives, and Dalrymple filled the glasses up again.</p>
<p>"What, in the name of all that's mischievous, can have become of
Sullivan?" said he to me. "I have not caught so much as a glimpse
of him for the last hour."</p>
<p>"When I last saw him, he was dancing."</p>
<p>"Yes, with a pretty little dark-eyed girl in a blue dress. By
Jove! that fellow will be getting into trouble if left to
himself!"</p>
<p>"But the girl has her mother with her!"</p>
<p>"All the stronger probability of a scrimmage," replied
Dalrymple, sipping his punch with a covert glance of salutation at
Suzette.</p>
<p>"Shall I see if they are among the dancers?"</p>
<p>"Do--but make haste; for the punch is disappearing fast."</p>
<p>I left them, and went back to the platform where the
indefatigable public was now engaged in the performance of
quadrilles. Never, surely, were people so industrious in the
pursuit of pleasure! They poussetted, bowed, curtsied, joined
hands, and threaded the mysteries of every figure, as if their very
lives depended on their agility.</p>
<p>"Look at Jean Thomas," said a young girl to her still younger
companion. "He dances like an angel!"</p>
<p>The one thus called upon to admire, looked at Jean Thomas, and
sighed.</p>
<p>"He never asks me, by any chance," said she, sadly, "although
his mother and mine are good neighbors. I suppose I don't dance
well enough--or dress well enough," she added, glancing at her
friend's gay shawl and coquettish cap.</p>
<p>"He has danced with me twice this evening," said the first
speaker triumphantly; "and he danced with me twice last Sunday at
the Jardin d'Armide. Elise says...."</p>
<p>Her voice dropped to a whisper, and I heard no more. It was a
passing glimpse behind the curtain--a peep at one of the many
dramas of real life that are being played for ever around us. Here
were all the elements of romance--love, admiration, vanity, envy.
Here was a hero in humble life--a lady-killer in his own little
sphere. He dances with one, neglects another, and multiplies his
conquests with all the heartlessness of a gentleman.</p>
<p>I wandered round the platform once or twice, scrutinizing the
dancers, but without success. There was no sign of Sullivan, or of
his partner, or of his partner's mother, the <i>bourgeoise</i> with
the green fan. I then went to the grotto of the fortune-teller, but
it was full of noisy rustics; and thence to the lottery hall, where
there were plenty of players, but not those of whom I was in
search.</p>
<p>"Wheel of fortune, Messieurs et Mesdames," said the young lady
behind the counter. "Only fifty centimes each. All prizes, and no
blanks--try your fortune, <i>monsieur le capitaine!</i> Put it
once, <i>monsieur le capitaine</i>; once for yourself, and once for
madame. Only fifty centimes each, and the certainty of
winning!"</p>
<p><i>Monsieur le capitaine</i> was a great, rawboned corporal,
with a pretty little maid-servant on his arm. The flattery was not
very delicate; but it succeeded. He threw down a franc. The wheel
flew round, the papers were drawn, and the corporal won a
needle-case, and the maid-servant a cigar-holder. In the midst of
the laugh to which this distribution gave rise, I walked away in
the direction of the refreshment stalls. Here were parties supping
substantially, dancers drinking orgeat and lemonade, and little
knots of tradesmen and mechanics sipping beer ridiculously out of
wine-glasses to an accompaniment of cakes and sweet-biscuits. Still
I could see no trace of Mr. Frank Sullivan.</p>
<p>At length I gave up the search in despair, and on my way back
encountered Master Philippe leaning against a tree, and looking
exceedingly helpless and unwell.</p>
<p>"You ate too many eggs, Philippe," said his mother. "I told you
so at the time."</p>
<p>"It--it wasn't the eggs," faltered the wretched Philippe. "It
was the Russian swing."</p>
<p>"And serve you rightly, too," said his father angrily. "I wish
with all my heart that you had had your favorite oysters as
well!"</p>
<p>When I came back to the arbor, I found the little party
immensely happy, and a fresh bowl of punch just placed upon the
table. Andr&eacute; was sitting next to Suzette, as proud as a
king. Madame Roquet, volubly convivial, was talking to every one.
Madame Robineau was silently disposing of all the biscuits and
punch that came in her way. Monsieur Robineau, with his hat a
little pushed back and his thumb in the arm-hole of his waistcoat,
was telling a long story to which nobody listened; while Dalrymple,
sitting on the other side of the bride, was gallantly doing the
duties of entertainer.</p>
<p>He looked up--I shook my head, slipped back into my place, and
listened to the tangled threads of conversation going on around
me.</p>
<p>"And so," said Monsieur Robineau, proceeding with his story, and
staring down into the bottom of his empty glass, "and so I said to
myself, 'Robineau, <i>mon ami</i>, take care. One honest man is
better than two rogues; and if thou keepest thine eyes open, the
devil himself stands small chance of cheating thee!' So I buttoned
up my coat--this very coat I have on now, only that I have re-lined
and re-cuffed it since then, and changed the buttons for brass
ones; and brass buttons for one's holiday coat, you know, look so
much more <i>comme il faut</i>--and said to the landlord...."</p>
<p>"Another glass of punch, Monsieur Robineau," interrupted
Dalrymple.</p>
<p>"Thank you, M'sieur, you are very good; well, as I was
saying...."</p>
<p>"Ah, bah, brother Jacques!" exclaimed Madame Roquet,
impatiently, "don't give us that old story of the miller and the
gray colt, this evening! We've all heard it a hundred times
already. Sing us a song instead, <i>mon ami</i>!"</p>
<p>"I shall be happy to sing, sister Marie," replied Monsieur
Robineau, with somewhat husky dignity, "when I have finished my
story. You may have heard the story before. So may Andr&eacute;--so
may Suzette--so may my wife. I admit it. But these gentlemen--these
gentlemen who have never heard it, and who have done me the
honor...."</p>
<p>"Not to listen to a word of it," said Madame Robineau, sharply.
"There, you are answered, husband. Drink your punch, and hold your
tongue."</p>
<p>Monsieur Robineau waved his hand majestically, and assumed a
Parliamentary air.</p>
<p>"Madame Robineau," he said, getting more and more husky, "be so
obliging as to wait till I ask for your advice. With regard to
drinking my punch, I have drunk it--" and here he again stared down
into the bottom of his glass, which was again empty--"and with
regard to holding my tongue, that is my business, and--and...."</p>
<p>"Monsieur Robineau," said Dalrymple, "allow me to offer you some
more punch."</p>
<p>"Not another drop, Jacques," said Madame, sternly. "You have had
too much already."</p>
<p>Poor Monsieur Robineau, who had put out his glass to be
refilled, paused and looked helplessly at his wife.</p>
<p>"<i>Mon cher ange</i>,...." he began; but she shook her head
inflexibly, and Monsieur Robineau submitted with the air of a man
who knows that from the sentence of the supreme court there is no
appeal.</p>
<p>"<i>D&acirc;me</i>!" whispered Madame Roquet, with a
confidential attack upon my ribs that gave me a pain in my side for
half an hour after, "my brother has the heart of a rabbit. He gives
way to her in everything--so much the worse for him. My blessed
man, who was a saint of a husband, would have broken the bowl over
my ears if I had dared to interfere between his glass and his
mouth!"</p>
<p>Whereupon Madame Roquet filled her own glass and mine, and
Madame Robineau, less indulgent to her husband than herself,
followed our example.</p>
<p>Just at this moment, a confused hubbub of voices, and other
sounds expressive of a <i>fracas</i>, broke out in the direction of
the trees behind the orchestra. The dancers deserted their polka,
the musicians stopped fiddling, the noisy supper-party in the next
arbor abandoned their cold chicken and salad, and everybody ran to
the scene of action. Dalrymple was on his feet in a moment; but
Suzette held Andr&eacute; back with both hands and implored him to
stay.</p>
<p>"Some <i>mauvais sujets</i>, no doubt, who refuse to pay the
score," suggested Madame Roquet.</p>
<p>"Or Sullivan, who has got into one of his infernal scrapes,"
muttered Dalrymple, with a determined wrench at his moustache.
"Come on, anyhow, and let us see what is the matter!"</p>
<p>So we snatched up our hats and ran out, just as Monsieur
Robineau seized the opportunity to drink another tumbler of punch
when his wife was not looking.</p>
<p>Following in the direction of the rest, we took one of the paths
behind the orchestra, and came upon a noisy crowd gathered round a
wooden summer-house.</p>
<p>"It's a fight," said one.</p>
<p>"It's a pickpocket," said another.</p>
<p>"Bah! it's only a young fellow who has been making love to a
girl," exclaimed a third.</p>
<p>We forced our way through, and there we saw Mr. Frank Sullivan
with his hat off, his arms crossed, and his back against the wall,
presenting a dauntless front to the gesticulations and threats of
an exceedingly enraged young man with red hair, who was abusing him
furiously. The amount of temper displayed by this young man was
something unparalleled. He was angry in every one of his limbs. He
stamped, he shook his fist, he shook his head. The very tips of his
ears looked scarlet with rage. Every now and then he faced round to
the spectators, and appealed to them--or to a stout woman with a
green fan, who was almost as red and angry as himself, and who
always rushed forward when addressed, and shook the green fan in
Sullivan's face.</p>
<p>"You are an aristocrat!" stormed the young man. "A pampered,
insolent aristocrat! A dog of an Englishman! A
<i>sc&eacute;l&eacute;rat</i>! Don't suppose you are to trample
upon us for nothing! We are Frenchmen, you beggarly
islander--Frenchmen, do you hear?"</p>
<p>A growl of sympathetic indignation ran through the crowd, and
"<i>&agrave; bas les aristocrats</i>--<i>&agrave; bas les
Anglais</i>!" broke out here and there.</p>
<p>"In the devil's name, Sullivan," said Dalrymple, shouldering his
way up to the object of these agreeable menaces, "what have you
been after, to bring this storm about your ears?"</p>
<p>"Pshaw! nothing at all," replied he with a mocking laugh, and a
contemptuous gesture. "I danced with a pretty girl, and treated her
to champagne afterwards. Her mother and brother hunted us out, and
spoiled our flirtation. That's the whole story."</p>
<p>Something in the laugh and gesture--something, too, perhaps in
the language which they could not understand, appeared to give the
last aggravation to both of Sullivan's assailants. I saw the young
man raise his arm to strike--I saw Dalrymple fell him with a blow
that would have stunned an ox--I saw the crowd close in, heard the
storm break out on every side, and, above it all, the deep, strong
tones of Dalrymple's voice, saying:--</p>
<p>"To the boat, boys! Follow me."</p>
<p>In another moment he had flung himself into the crowd, dealt one
or two sounding blows to left and right, cleared a passage for
himself and us, and sped away down one of the narrow walks leading
to the river. Presently, having taken one or two turnings, none of
which seemed to lead to the spot we sought, we came upon an open
space full of piled-up benches, pyramids of empty bottles, boxes,
baskets, and all kinds of lumber. Here we paused to listen and take
breath.</p>
<p>We had left the crowd behind us, but they were still within
hearing.</p>
<p>"By Jove!" said Dalrymple, "I don't know which way to go. I
believe we are on the wrong side of the island."</p>
<p>"And I believe they are after us," added Sullivan, peering into
the baskets. "By all that's fortunate, here are the fireworks! Has
anybody got a match? We'll take these with us, and go off in a
blaze of triumph!"</p>
<p>The suggestion was no sooner made than adopted. We filled our
hats and pockets with crackers and Catherine-wheels, piled the rest
into one great heap, threw a dozen or so of lighted fusees into the
midst of them, and just as the voices of our pursuers were growing
momentarily louder and nearer, darted away again down a fresh
turning, and saw the river gleaming at the end of it.</p>
<p>"Hurrah! here's a boat," shouted Sullivan, leaping into it, and
we after him.</p>
<p>It was not our boat, but we did not care for that. Ours was at
the other side of the island, far enough away, down by the
landing-place. Just as Dalrymple seized the oars, there burst forth
a tremendous explosion. A column of rockets shot up into the air,
and instantly the place was as light as day. Then a yell of
discovery broke forth, and we were seen almost as soon as we were
fairly out of reach. We had secured the only boat on that side of
the island, and three or four of Dalrymple's powerful strokes had
already carried us well into the middle of the stream. To let off
our own store of fireworks--to pitch tokens of our regard to our
friends on the island in the shape of blazing crackers, which fell
sputtering and fizzing into the water half-way between the boat and
the shore--to stand up in the stern and bow politely--finally, to
row away singing "God save the Queen" with all our might, were
feats upon which we prided ourselves very considerably at the time,
and the recollection of which afforded us infinite amusement all
the way home.</p>
<p>That evening we all supped together at the Chaval Blane, and of
what we did or said after supper I have but a confused remembrance.
I believe that I tried to smoke a cigar; and it is my impression
that I made a speech, in which I swore eternal friendship to both
of my new friends; but the only circumstance about which I cannot
be mistaken is that I awoke next morning with the worst specimen of
headache that had yet come within the limits of my experience.</p>

<h3>DAMON AND PYTHIAS.</h3>
<br>
<p>I left Rouen the day after my great adventure on the river, and
Captain Dalrymple went with me to the station.</p>
<p>"You have my Paris address upon my card," he said, as we walked
to and fro upon the platform. "It's just a bachelor's den, you
know--and I shall be there in about a fortnight or three weeks.
Come and look me up."</p>
<p>To which I replied that I was glad to be allowed to do so, and
that I should "look him up" as soon as he came home. And so, with
words of cordial good-will and a hearty shake of the hand, we
parted.</p>
<p>Having started late in the evening, I arrived in Paris between
four and five o'clock on a bright midsummer Sunday morning. I was
not long delayed by the customs officers, for I carried but a scant
supply of luggage. Having left this at an hotel, I wandered about
till it should be time for breakfast. After breakfast I meant to
dress and call upon Dr. Ch&eacute;ron.</p>
<p>The morning air was clear and cool. The sun shone brilliantly,
and was reflected back with dazzling vividness from long vistas of
high white houses, innumerable windows, and gilded balconies.
Theatres, shops, caf&eacute;s, and hotels not yet opened, lined the
great thoroughfares. Triumphal arches, columns, parks, palaces, and
churches succeeded one another in apparently endless succession. I
passed a lofty pillar crowned with a conqueror's statue--a palace
tragic in history--a modern Parthenon surrounded by columns,
peopled with sculptured friezes, and approached by a flight of
steps extending the whole width of the building. I went in, for the
doors had just been opened, and a white-haired Sacristan was
preparing the seats for matin service. There were acolytes
decorating the altar with fresh flowers, and early devotees on
their knees before the shrine of the Madonna. The gilded ornaments,
the tapers winking in the morning light, the statues, the
paintings, the faint clinging odors of incense, the hushed
atmosphere, the devotional silence, the marble angels kneeling
round the altar, all united to increase my dream of delight. I
gazed and gazed again; wandered round and round; and at last, worn
out with excitement and fatigue, sank into a chair in a distant
corner of the Church, and fell into a heavy sleep. How long it
lasted I know not; but the voices of the choristers and the deep
tones of the organ mingled with my dreams. When I awoke the last
worshippers were departing, the music had died into silence, the
wax-lights were being extinguished, and the service was ended.</p>
<p>Again I went out into the streets; but all was changed. Where
there had been the silence of early morning there was now the
confusion of a great city. Where there had been closed shutters and
deserted thoroughfares, there was the bustle of life, gayety,
business, and pleasure. The shops blazed with jewels and
merchandise; the stonemasons were at work on the new buildings; the
lemonade venders, with their gay reservoirs upon their backs, were
plying a noisy trade; the bill-stickers were papering boardings and
lamp-posts with variegated advertisements; the charlatan, in his
gaudy chariot, was selling pencils and penknives to the
accompaniment of a hand-organ; soldiers were marching to the
clangor of military music; the merchant was in his counting-house,
the stock-broker at the Bourse, and the lounger, whose name is
Legion, was sitting in the open air outside his favorite
caf&eacute;, drinking chocolate, and yawning over the
<i>Charivari</i>.</p>
<p>I thought I must be dreaming. I scarcely believed the evidence
of my eyes. Was this Sunday? Was it possible that in our own little
church at home--in our own little church, where we could hear the
birds twittering outside in every interval of the quiet
service--the old familiar faces, row beyond row, were even now
upturned in reverent attention to the words of the preacher? Prince
Bedreddin, transported in his sleep to the gates of Damascus, could
scarcely have opened his eyes upon a foreign city and a strange
people with more incredulous amazement.</p>
<p>I can now scarcely remember how that day of wonders went by. I
only know that I rambled about as in a dream, and am vaguely
conscious of having wandered through the gardens of the Tuilleries;
of having found the Louvre open, and of losing myself among some of
the upper galleries; of lying exhausted upon a bench in the Champs
Elys&eacute;es; of returning by quays lined with palaces and
spanned by noble bridges; of pacing round and round the enchanted
arcades of the Palais Royal; of wondering how and where I should
find my hotel, and of deciding at last that I could go no farther
without dining somehow. Wearied and half stupefied, I ventured, at
length, into one of the large <i>restaurants</i> upon the
Boulevards. Here I found spacious rooms lighted by superb
chandeliers which were again reflected in mirrors that extended
from floor to ceiling. Rows of small tables ran round the rooms,
and a double line down the centre, each laid with its snowy cloth
and glittering silver.</p>
<p>It was early when I arrived; so I passed up to the top of the
room and appropriated a small table commanding a view of the great
thoroughfare below. The waiters were slow to serve me; the place
filled speedily; and by the time I had finished my soup, nearly all
the tables were occupied. Here sat a party of officers, bronzed and
mustachioed; yonder a group of laughing girls; a pair of
provincials; a family party, children, governess and all; a stout
capitalist, solitary and self content; a quatuor of rollicking
<i>commis-voyageurs</i>; an English couple, perplexed and curious.
Amused by the sight of so many faces, listening to the hum of
voices, and watching the flying waiters bearing all kinds of
mysterious dishes, I loitered over my lonely meal, and wished that
this delightful whirl of novelty might last for ever. By and by a
gentleman entered, walked up the whole length of the room in search
of a seat, found my table occupied by only a single person, bowed
politely, and drew his chair opposite mine.</p>
<p>He was a portly man of about forty-five or fifty years of age,
with a broad, calm brow; curling light hair, somewhat worn upon the
temples; and large blue eyes, more keen than tender. His dress was
scrupulously simple, and his hands were immaculately white. He
carried an umbrella little thicker than a walking-stick, and wrote
out his list of dishes with a massive gold pencil. The waiter bowed
down before him as if he were an habitu&eacute; of the place.</p>
<p>It was not long before we fell into conversation. I do not
remember which spoke first; but we talked of Paris--or rather, I
talked and he listened; for, what with the excitement and fatigue
of the day, and what with the half bottle of champagne which I had
magnificently ordered, I found myself gifted with a sudden flood of
words, and ran on, I fear, not very discreetly.</p>
<p>A few civil rejoinders, a smile, a bow, an assent, a question
implied rather than spoken, sufficed to draw from me the
particulars of my journey. I told everything, from my birthplace
and education to my future plans and prospects; and the stranger,
with a frosty humor twinkling about his eyes, listened politely. He
was himself particularly silent; but he had the art of provoking
conversation while quietly enjoying his own dinner. When this was
finished, however, he leaned back in his chair, sipped his claret,
and talked a little more freely.</p>
<p>"And so," said he, in very excellent English, "you have come to
Paris to finish your studies. But have you no fear, young
gentleman, that the attractions of so gay a city may divert your
mind from graver subjects? Do you think that, when every pleasure
may be had for the seeking, you will be content to devote yourself
to the dry details of an uninteresting profession?"</p>
<p>"It is not an uninteresting profession," I replied. "I might
perhaps have preferred the church or the law; but having embarked
in the study of medicine, I shall do my best to succeed in it."</p>
<p>The stranger smiled.</p>
<p>"I am glad," he said, "to see you so ambitious. I do not doubt
that you will become a shining light in the brotherhood of
Esculapius."</p>
<p>"I hope so," I replied, boldly. "I have studied closer than most
men of my age, already."</p>
<p>He smiled again, coughed doubtfully, and insisted on filling my
glass from his own bottle.</p>
<p>"I only fear," he said, "that you will be too diffident of your
own merits. Now, when you call upon this Doctor....what did you say
was his name?"</p>
<p>"Ch&eacute;ron," I replied, huskily.</p>
<p>"True, Ch&eacute;ron. Well, when you meet him for the first time
you will, perhaps, be timid, hesitating, and silent. But, believe
me, a young man of your remarkable abilities should be
self-possessed. You ought to inspire him from the beginning with a
suitable respect for your talents."</p>
<p>"That's precisely the line I mean to take," said I, boastfully.
"I'll--I'll astonish him. I'm afraid of nobody--not I!"</p>
<p>The stranger filled my glass again. His claret must have been
very strong or my head very weak, for it seemed to me, as he did
so, that all the chandeliers were in motion.</p>
<p>"Upon my word," observed he, "you are a young man of infinite
spirit."</p>
<p>"And you," I replied, making an effort to bring the glass
steadily to my lips, "you are a capital fellow--a clear-sighted,
sensible, capital fellow. We'll be friends."</p>
<p>He bowed, and said, somewhat coldly,</p>
<p>"I have no doubt that we shall become better acquainted."</p>
<p>"Better acquainted, indeed!--we'll be intimate!" I ejaculated,
affectionately. "I'll introduce you to Dalrymple--you'll like him
excessively. Just the fellow to delight you."</p>
<p>"So I should say," observed the stranger, drily.</p>
<p>"And as for you and myself, we'll--we'll be Damon and ... what's
the other one's name?"</p>
<p>"Pythias," replied my new acquaintance, leaning back in his
chair, and surveying me with a peculiar and very deliberate stare.
"Exactly so--Damon and Pythias! A charming arrangement."</p>
<p>"Bravo! Famous! And now we'll have another bottle of wine."</p>
<p>"Not on my account, I beg," said the gentleman firmly. "My head
is not so cool as yours."</p>
<p>Cool, indeed, and the room whirling round and round, like a
teetotum!</p>
<p>"Oh, if you won't, I won't," said I confusedly; "but I--I
could--drink my share of another bottle, I assure you, and
not--feel the slightest...."</p>
<p>"I have no doubt on that point," said my neighbor, gravely; "but
our French wines are deceptive, Mr. Arbuthnot, and you might
possibly suffer some inconvenience to-morrow. You, as a medical
man, should understand the evils of dyspepsia."</p>
<p>"Dy--dy--dyspepsia be hanged," I muttered, dreamily. "Tell me,
friend--by the by, I forget your name. Friend what?"</p>
<p>"Friend Pythias," returned the stranger, drily. "You gave me the
name yourself."</p>
<p>"Ay, but your real name?"</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>"One name is as good as another," said he, lightly. "Let it be
Pythias, for the present. But you were about to ask me some
question?"</p>
<p>"About old Ch&eacute;ron," I said, leaning both elbows on the
table, and speaking very confidentially. "Now tell me, have
you--have you any notion of what he is like? Do you--know--know
anything about him?"</p>
<p>"I have heard of him," he replied, intent for the moment on the
pattern of his wine-glass.</p>
<p>"Clever?"</p>
<p>"That is a point upon which I could not venture an opinion. You
must ask some more competent judge."</p>
<p>"Come, now," said I, shaking my head, and trying to look
knowing; "you--you know what I mean, well enough. Is he a grim old
fellow? A--a--griffin, you know! Come, is he a
gr--r--r--riffin?"</p>
<p>My words had by this time acquired a distressing,
self-propelling tendency, and linked themselves into compounds of
twenty and thirty syllables.</p>
<p>My <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> smiled, bit his lip, then laughed a
dry, short laugh.</p>
<p>"Really," he said, "I am not in a position to reply to your
question; but upon the whole, I should say that Dr. Ch&eacute;ron
was not quite a griffin. The species, you see, is extinct."</p>
<p>I roared with laughter; vowed I had never heard a better joke in
my life; and repeated his last words over and over, like a degraded
idiot as I was. All at once a sense of deadly faintness came upon
me. I turned hot and cold by turns, and lifting my hand to my head,
said, or tried to say:--</p>
<p>"Room's--'bominably--close!"</p>
<p>"We had better go," he replied promptly. "The air will do you
good. Leave me to settle for our dinners, and you shall make it
right with me by-and-by."</p>
<p>He did so, and we left the room. Once out in the open air I
found myself unable to stand. He called a <i>fiacre</i>; almost
lifted me in; took his place beside me, and asked the name of my
hotel.</p>
<p>I had forgotten it; but I knew that it was opposite the railway
station, and that was enough. When we arrived, I was on the verge
of insensibility. I remember that I was led up-stairs by two
waiters, and that the stranger saw me to my room. Then all was
darkness and stupor.</p>

<h3>THE NEXT MORNING.</h3>
<br>
<p>"Oh, my Christian ducats!" <i>Merchant of Venice</i>.</p>
<p>Gone!--gone!--both gone!--my new gold watch and my purse full of
notes and Napoleons!</p>
<p>I rang the bell furiously. It was answered by a demure-looking
waiter, with a face like a parroquet.</p>
<p>"Does Monsieur please to require anything?"</p>
<p>"Require anything!" I exclaimed, in the best French I could
muster. "I have been robbed!"</p>
<p>"Robbed, Monsieur?"</p>
<p>"Yes, of my watch and purse!"</p>
<p>"<i>Tiens</i>! Of a watch and purse?" repeated the parroquet,
lifting his eyebrows with an air of well-bred surprise. "<i>C'est
dr&ocirc;le."</i></p>
<p>"Droll!" I cried, furiously. "Droll, you scoundrel! I'll let you
know whether I think it droll! I'll complain to the authorities!
I'll have the house searched! I'll--I'll...."</p>
<p>I rang the bell again. Two or three more waiters came, and the
master of the hotel. They all treated my communication in the same
manner--coolly; incredulously; but with unruffled politeness.</p>
<p>"Monsieur forgets," urged the master, "that he came back to the
hotel last night in a state of absolute intoxication. Monsieur was
accompanied by a stranger, who was gentlemanly, it it true; but
since Monsieur acknowledges that that stranger was personally
unknown to him, Monsieur may well perceive it would be more
reasonable if his suspicions first pointed in that direction."</p>
<p>Struck by the force of this observation, I flung myself into a
chair and remained silent.</p>
<p>"Has Monsieur no acquaintances in Paris to whom he may apply for
advice?" inquired the landlord.</p>
<p>"None," said I, moodily; "except that I have a letter of
introduction to one Dr. Ch&eacute;ron."</p>
<p>The landlord and his waiters exchanged glances.</p>
<p>"I would respectfully recommend Monsieur to present his letter
immediately," said the former. "Monsieur le Docteur Ch&eacute;ron
is a man of the world--a man of high reputation and sagacity.
Monsieur could not do better than advise with him."</p>
<p>"Call a cab for me," said I, after a long pause. "I will
go."</p>
<p>The determination cost me something. Dismayed by the extent of
my loss, racked with headache, languid, pale, and full of remorse
for last night's folly, it needed but this humiliation to complete
my misery. What! appear before my instructor for the first time
with such a tale! I could have bitten my lips through with
vexation.</p>
<p>The cab was called. I saw, but would not see, the winks and nods
exchanged behind my back by the grinning waiters. I flung myself
into the vehicle, and soon was once more rattling through the noisy
streets. But those brilliant streets had now lost all their charm
for me. I admired nothing, saw nothing, heard nothing, on the way.
I could think only of my father's anger and the contempt of Dr.
Ch&eacute;ron.</p>
<p>Presently the cab stopped before a large wooden gate with two
enormous knockers. One half of this gate was opened by a servant in
a sad-colored livery. I was shown across a broad courtyard, up a
flight of lofty steps, and into a spacious <i>salon</i> plainly
furnished.</p>
<p>"Monsieur le Docteur is at present engaged," said the servant,
with an air of profound respect. "Will Monsieur have the goodness
to be seated for a few moments."</p>
<p>I sat down. I rose up. I examined the books upon the table, and
the pictures on the walls. I wished myself "anywhere, anywhere out
of the world," and more than once was on the point of stealing out
of the house, jumping into my cab, and making off without seeing
the doctor at all. One consideration alone prevented me. I had lost
all my money, and had not even a franc left to pay the driver.
Presently the door again opened, the grave footman reappeared, and
I heard the dreaded announcement:--"Monsieur le Docteur will be
happy to receive Monsieur in his consulting-room."</p>
<p>I followed mechanically. We passed through a passage thickly
carpeted, and paused before a green baize door. This door opened
noiselessly, and I found myself in the great man's presence.</p>
<p>"It gives me pleasure to welcome the son of my old friend John
Arbuthnot," said a clear, and not unfamiliar voice.</p>
<p>I started, looked up, grew red and white, hot and cold, and had
not a syllable to utter in reply.</p>
<p>In Doctor Ch&eacute;ron, I recognised--</p>
<p>PYTHIAS!</p>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI."></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<h3>MYSTERIOUS PROCEEDINGS.</h3>
<br>
<p>The doctor pointed to a chair, looked at his watch, and
said:--</p>
<p>"I hope you have had a pleasant journey. Arrived this
morning?"</p>
<p>There was not the faintest gleam of recognition on his face. Not
a smile; not a glance; nothing but the easy politeness of a
stranger to a stranger.</p>
<p>"N--not exactly," I faltered. "Yesterday morning, sir."</p>
<p>"Ah, indeed! Spent the day in sight-seeing, I dare say. Admire
Paris?"</p>
<p>Too much astonished to speak, I took refuge in a bow.</p>
<p>"Not found any lodgings yet, I presume?" asked the doctor,
mending a pen very deliberately.</p>
<p>"N--not yet, sir."</p>
<p>"I concluded so The English do not seek apartments on Sunday.
You observe the day very strictly, no doubt?"</p>
<p>Blushing and confused, I stammered some incoherent words and sat
twirling my hat, the very picture of remorse.</p>
<p>"At what hotel have you put up?" he next inquired, without
appearing to observe my agitation.</p>
<p>"The--the H&ocirc;tel des Messageries."</p>
<p>"Good, but expensive. You must find a lodging to-day."</p>
<p>I bowed again.</p>
<p>"And, as your father's representative, I must take care that you
procure something suitable, and are not imposed upon. My valet
shall go with you."</p>
<p>He rang the bell, and the sad-colored footman appeared on the
threshold.</p>
<p>"Desire Brunet to be in readiness to walk out with this
gentleman," he said, briefly, and the servant retired.</p>
<p>"Brunet," he continued, addressing me again, "is faithful and
sagacious. He will instruct you on certain points indispensable to
a resident in Paris, and will see that you are not ill-accommodated
or overcharged. A young man has few wants, and I should infer that
a couple of rooms in some quiet street will be all that you
require?"</p>
<p>"I--I am very grateful."</p>
<p>He waved down my thanks with an air of cold but polite
authority; took out his note-book and pencil; (I could have sworn
to that massive gold pencil!) and proceeded to question me.</p>
<p>"Your age, I think," said he, "is twenty-one?"</p>
<p>"Twenty, sir."</p>
<p>"Ah--twenty. You desire to be entered upon the list of visiting
students at the Hotel Dieu, to be free of the library and
lecture-rooms, and to be admitted into my public classes?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Also, to attend here in my house for private instruction."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>He filled in a few words upon a printed form, and handed it to
me with his visiting card.</p>
<p>"You will present these, and your passport, to the secretary at
the hospital," said he, "and will receive in return the requisite
tickets of admission. Your fees have already been paid in, and your
name has been entered. You must see to this matter at once, for the
<i>bureau</i> closes at two o'clock. You will then require the rest
of the day for lodging-seeking, moving, and so forth. To-morrow
morning, at nine o'clock, I shall expect you here."</p>
<p>"Indeed, sir," I murmured, "I am more obliged than...."</p>
<p>"Not in the least," he interrupted, decisively; "your father's
son has every claim upon me. I object to thanks. All that I require
from you are habits of industry, punctuality, and respect. Your
father speaks well of you, and I have no doubt I shall find you all
that he represents. Can I do anything more for you this
morning?"</p>
<p>I hesitated; could not bring myself to utter one word of that
which I had come to say; and murmured--</p>
<p>"Nothing more, I thank you, sir."</p>
<p>He looked at me piercingly, paused an instant, and then rang the
bell.</p>
<p>"I am about to order my carriage," he said; "and, as I am going
in that direction, I will take you as far as the H&ocirc;tel
Dieu."</p>
<p>"But--but I have a cab at the door," I faltered, remembering,
with a sinking heart, that I had not a sou to pay the driver.</p>
<p>The servant appeared again.</p>
<p>"Let the carriage be brought round immediately, and dismiss this
gentleman's cab."</p>
<p>The man retired, and I heaved a sigh of relief. The doctor bent
low over the papers on his desk, and I fancied for the moment that
a faint smile flitted over his face. Then he took up his hat, and
pointed to the door.</p>
<p>"Now, my young friend," he said authoritatively, "we must be
gone. Time is gold. After you."</p>
<p>I bowed and preceded him. His very courtesy was sterner than the
displeasure of another, and I already felt towards him a greater
degree of awe than I should have quite cared to confess. The
carriage was waiting in the courtyard. I placed myself with my back
to the horses; Dr. Ch&eacute;ron flung himself upon the opposite
seat; a servant out of livery sprang up beside the coachman; the
great gates were flung open; and we glided away on the easiest of
springs and the softest of cushions.</p>
<p>Dr. Ch&eacute;ron took a newspaper from his pocket, and began to
read; so leaving me to my own uncomfortable reflections.</p>
<p>And, indeed, when I came to consider my position I was almost in
despair. Moneyless, what was to become of me? Watchless and
moneyless, with a bill awaiting me at my hotel, and not a stiver in
my pocket wherewith to pay it.... Miserable pupil of a stern
master! luckless son of a savage father! to whom could I turn for
help? Not certainly to Dr. Ch&eacute;ron, whom I had been ready to
accuse, half an hour ago, of having stolen my watch and purse.
Petty larceny and Dr. Ch&eacute;ron! how ludicrously incongruous!
And yet, where was my property? Was the H&ocirc;tel des Messageries
a den of thieves? And again, how was it that this same Dr.
Ch&eacute;ron looked, and spoke, and acted, as if he had never seen
me in his life till this morning? Was I mad, or dreaming, or
both?</p>
<p>The carriage stopped and the door opened.</p>
<p>"H&ocirc;tel Dieu, M'sieur," said the servant, touching his
hat.</p>
<p>Dr. Ch&eacute;ron just raised his eyes from the paper.</p>
<p>"This is your first destination," he said. "I would advise you,
on leaving here, to return to your hotel. There may be letters
awaiting you. Good-morning."</p>
<p>With this he resumed his paper, the carriage rolled away, and I
found myself at the H&ocirc;tel Dieu, with the servant out of
livery standing respectfully behind me.</p>
<p>Go back to my hotel! Why should I go back? Letters there could
be none, unless at the Poste Restante. I thought this a very
unnecessary piece of advice, rejected it in my own mind, and so
went into the hospital <i>bureau</i>, and transacted my business.
When I came out again, Brunet took the lead.</p>
<p>He was an elderly man with a solemn countenance and a mysterious
voice. His manner was oppressively respectful; his address
diplomatic; his step stealthy as a courtier's. When we came to a
crossing he bowed, stood aside, and followed me; then took the lead
again; and so on, during a brisk walk of about half an hour. All at
once, I found myself at the H&ocirc;tel des Messageries.</p>
<p>"Monsieur's hotel," said the doctor's valet, touching his
hat.</p>
<p>"You are mistaken," said I, rather impatiently. "I did not ask
to be brought here. My object this morning is to look for
apartments."</p>
<p>"Post in at mid-day, Monsieur," he observed, gravely.
"Monsieur's letters may have arrived."</p>
<p>"I expect none, thank you."</p>
<p>"Monsieur will, nevertheless, permit me to inquire," said the
persevering valet, and glided in before my eyes.</p>
<p>The thing was absurd! Both master and servant insisted that I
must have letters, whether I would, or no! To my amazement,
however, Brunet came back with a small sealed box in his hands.</p>
<p>"No letters have arrived for Monsieur," he said; "but this box
was left with the porter about an hour ago."</p>
<p>I weighed it, shook it, examined the seals, and, going into the
public room, desired Brunet to follow me. There I opened it. It
contained a folded paper, a quantity of wadding, my purse, my roll
of bank-notes, and my watch! On the paper, I read the following
words:--</p>
<p>"Learn from the events of last night the value of temperance,
the wisdom of silence, and the danger of chance acquaintanceships.
Accept the lesson, and he by whom it is administered will forget
the error."</p>
<p>The paper dropped from my hands and fell upon the floor. The
impenetrable Brunet picked it up, and returned it to me.</p>
<p>"Brunet!" I ejaculated.</p>
<p>"Monsieur?" said he, interrogatively, raising his hand to his
forehead by force of habit, although his hat stood beside him on
the floor.</p>
<p>There was not a shadow of meaning in his face--not a quiver to
denote that he knew anything of what had passed. To judge by the
stolid indifference of his manner, one might have supposed that the
delivery of caskets full of watches and valuables was an event of
daily occurrence in the house of Dr. Ch&eacute;ron. His coolness
silenced me. I drew a long breath; hastened to put my watch in my
pocket, and lock up my money in my room; and then went to the
master of the hotel, and informed him of the recovery of my
property. He smiled and congratulated me; but he did not seem to be
in the least surprised. I fancied, some how, that matters were not
quite so mysterious to him as they had been to me.</p>
<p>I also fancied that I heard a suspicious roar of laughter as I
passed out into the street.</p>
<p>It was not long before I found such apartments as I required,
Piloted by Brunet through some broad thoroughfares and along part
of the Boulevards, I came upon a cluster of narrow streets
branching off through a massive stone gateway from the Rue du
Faubourg Montmartre. This little nook was called the Cit&eacute;
Berg&egrave;re. The houses were white and lofty. Some had
courtyards, and all were decorated with pretty iron balconies and
delicately-tinted Venetian shutters. Most of them bore the
announcement--"<i>Apartements &agrave; louer</i>"--suspended above
the door. Outside one of these houses sat two men with a little
table between them. They were playing at dominoes, and wore the
common blue blouse of the mechanic class. A woman stood by, paring
celery, with an infant playing on the mat inside the door and a cat
purring at her feet. It was a pleasant group. The men looked
honest, the woman good-tempered, and the house exquisitely clean;
so the diplomatic Brunet went forward to negotiate, while I walked
up and down outside. There were rooms to be let on the second,
third and fifth floors. The fifth was too high, and the second too
expensive; but the third seemed likely to suit me. The <i>suite</i>
consisted of a bed-room, dressing-room, and tiny <i>salon</i>, and
was furnished with the elegant uncomfortableness characteristic of
our French neighbors. Here were floors shiny and carpetless;
windows that objected to open, and drawers that refused to shut;
mirrors all round the walls a set of hanging shelves; an ormolu
time piece that struck all kinds of miscellaneous hours at
unexpected times; an abundance of vases filled with faded
artificial flowers; insecure chairs of white and gold; and a round
table that had a way of turning over suddenly like a table in a
pantomime, if you ventured to place anything on any part but the
inlaid star in the centre. Above all, there was a balcony big
enough for a couple of chairs, and some flower-pots, overlooking
the street.</p>
<p>I was delighted with everything. In imagination I beheld my
balcony already blooming with roses, and my shelves laden with
books. I admired the white and gold chairs with all my heart, and
saw myself reflected in half a dozen mirrors at once with an
innocent pride of ownership which can only be appreciated by those
who have tasted the supreme luxury of going into chambers for the
first time.</p>
<p>"Shall I conclude for Monsieur at twenty francs a week?"
murmured the sagacious Brunet.</p>
<p>"Of course," said I, laying the first week's rent upon the
table.</p>
<p>And so the thing was done, and, brimful of satisfaction, I went
off to the hotel for my luggage, and moved in immediately.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII."></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<h3>BROADCLOTH AND CIVILIZATION.</h3>
<br>
<p>Allowing for my inexperience in the use of the language, I
prospered better than I had expected, and found, to my
satisfaction, that I was by no means behind my French
fellow-students in medical knowledge. I passed through my
preliminary examination with credit, and although Dr. Ch&eacute;ron
was careful not to praise me too soon, I had reason to believe that
he was satisfied with my progress. My life, indeed, was now wholly
given up to my work. My country-breeding had made me timid, and the
necessity for speaking a foreign tongue served only to increase my
natural reserve; so that although I lived and studied day after day
in the society of some two or three hundred young men, I yet lived
as solitary a life as Robinson Crusoe in his island. No one sought
to know me. No one took a liking for me. Gay, noisy, chattering
fellows that they were, they passed me by for a "dull and
muddy-pated rogue;" voted me uncompanionable when I was only shy;
and, doubtless, quoted me to each other as a rare specimen of the
silent Englishman. I lived, too, quite out of the students' colony.
To me the <i>Quartier Latin</i> (except as I went to and fro
between the Hotel Dieu and the Ecole de Medicine) was a land
unknown; and the student's life--that wonderful <i>Vie de
Boh&eacute;me</i> which furnishes forth half the fiction of the
Paris press--a condition of being, about which I had never even
heard. What wonder, then, that I never arrived at Dr.
Ch&eacute;ron's door five minutes behind time, never missed a
lecture, never forgot an appointment? What wonder that, after
dropping moodily into one or two of the theatres, I settled down
quite quietly in my lodgings; gave up my days to study; sauntered
about the lighted alleys of the Champs Elys&eacute;es in the sweet
spring evenings, and, going home betimes, spent an hour or two with
my books, and kept almost as early hours as in my father's house at
Saxonholme?</p>
<p>After I had been living thus for rather longer than three weeks,
I made up my mind one Sunday morning to call at Dalrymple's rooms,
and inquire if he had yet arrived in Paris. It was about eleven
o'clock when I reached the Chauss&eacute;e d'Antin, and there
learned that he was not only arrived, but at home. Being by this
time in possession of the luxury of a card, I sent one up, and was
immediately admitted. I found breakfast still upon the table;
Dalrymple sitting with an open desk and cash-box before him; and,
standing somewhat back, with his elbow resting on the
chimney-piece, a gentleman smoking a cigar. They both looked up as
I was announced, and Dalrymple, welcoming me with a hearty grasp,
introduced this gentleman as Monsieur de Simoncourt.</p>
<p>M. de Simoncourt bowed, knocked the ash from his cigar, and
looked as if he wished me at the Antipodes. Dalrymple was really
glad to see me.</p>
<p>"I have been expecting you, Arbuthnot," said he, "for the last
week. If you had not soon beaten up my quarters, I should have
tried, somehow, to find out yours. What have you been about all
this time? Where are you located? What mischief have you been
perpetrating since our expedition to the <i>guingette</i> on the
river? Come, you have a thousand things to tell me!"</p>
<p>M. de Simoncourt looked at his watch--a magnificent affair,
decorated with a costly chain, and a profusion of pendant
trifles--and threw the last-half of his cigar into the
fireplace.</p>
<p>"You must excuse me, <i>mon cher</i>" said he. "I have at least
a dozen calls to make before dinner."</p>
<p>Dalrymple rose, readily enough, and took a roll of bank-notes
from the cash-box.</p>
<p>"If you are going," he said, "I may as well hand over the price
of that Tilbury. When will they send it home?"</p>
<p>"To-morrow, undoubtedly."</p>
<p>"And I am to pay fifteen hundred franks for it!"</p>
<p>"Just half its value!" observed M. de Simoncourt, with a shrug
of his shoulders.</p>
<p>Dalrymple smiled, counted the notes, and handed them to his
friend.</p>
<p>"Fifteen hundred may be half its cost," said he; "but I doubt if
I am paying much less than its full value. Just see that these are
right."</p>
<p>M. de Simoncourt ruffled the papers daintily over, and consigned
them to his pocket-book. As he did so, I could not help observing
the whiteness of his hands and the sparkle of a huge brilliant on
his little finger. He was a pale, slender, olive-hued man, with
very dark eyes, and glittering teeth, and a black moustache
inclining superciliously upwards at each corner; somewhat too
<i>nonchalant</i>, perhaps, in his manner, and somewhat too profuse
in the article of jewellery; but a very elegant gentleman,
nevertheless.</p>
<p>"<i>Bon</i>!" said he. "I am glad you have bought it. I would
have taken it myself, had the thing happened a week or two earlier.
Poor Duchesne! To think that he should have come to this, after
all!"</p>
<p>"I am sorry for him," said Dalrymple; "but it is a case of
wilful ruin. He made up his mind to go to the devil, and went
accordingly. I am only surprised that the crash came no
sooner."</p>
<p>M. de Simoneourt twitched at the supercilious moustache.</p>
<p>"And you think you would not care to take the black mare with
the Tilbury?" said he, negligently.</p>
<p>"No--I have a capital horse, already."</p>
<p>"Hah I--well--'tis almost a pity. The mare is a dead bargain.
Shouldn't wonder if I buy her, after all."</p>
<p>"And yet you don't want her," said Dalrymple.</p>
<p>"Quite true; but one must have a favorite sin, and horseflesh is
mine. I shall ruin myself by it some day--<i>mort de ma vie!</i> By
the way, have you seen my chestnut in harness? No? Then you will be
really pleased. Goes delightfully with the gray, and manages tandem
to perfection. <i>Parbleu!</i> I was forgetting--do we meet
to-night?"</p>
<p>"Where?"</p>
<p>"At Chardonnier's."</p>
<p>Dalrymple shook his head, and turned the key in his cash
box.</p>
<p>"Not this evening," he replied. I have other engagements."</p>
<p>"Bah! and I promised to go, believing you were sure to be of the
party. St. Pol, I know, will be there, and De Br&eacute;zy
also."</p>
<p>"Chardonnier's parties are charming things in their way," said
Dalrymple, somewhat coldly, "and no man enjoys Burgundy and
lansquenet more heartily than myself; but one might grow to care
for nothing else, and I have no desire to fall into worse habits
than those I have contracted already."</p>
<p>M. de Simoneourt laughed a dry, short laugh, and twitched again
at the supercilious moustache.</p>
<p>"I had no idea you were a philosopher," said he.</p>
<p>"Nor am I. I am a <i>mauvais sujet</i>--<i>mauvais</i> enough,
already, without seeking to become worse."</p>
<p>"Well, adieu--I will see to this affair of the Tilbury, and
desire them to let you have it by noon to-morrow."</p>
<p>"A thousand thanks. I am ashamed that you have so much trouble
in the matter. <i>Au revoir</i>."</p>
<p>"<i>Au revoir</i>."</p>
<p>Whereupon M. de Simoncourt honored me with a passing bow, and
took his departure. Being near the window, I saw him spring into an
elegant cabriolet, and drive off with the showiest of high horses
and the tiniest of tigers.</p>
<p>He was no sooner gone than Dalrymple took me by the shoulders,
placed me in an easy chair, poured out a couple of glasses of hock,
and said:--</p>
<p>"Now, then, my young friend, your news or your life! Out with
it, every word, as you hope to be forgiven!"</p>
<p>I had but little to tell, and for that little, found myself, as
I had anticipated, heartily laughed at. My adventure at the
restaurant, my unlucky meeting with Dr. Ch&eacute;ron, and the
history of my interview with him next morning, delighted Dalrymple
beyond measure.</p>
<p>Nothing would satisfy him, after this, but to call me Damon, to
tease me continually about Doctor Pythias, and to remind me at
every turn of the desirableness of Arcadian friendships.</p>
<p>"And so, Damon," said he, "you go nowhere, see nothing, and know
nobody. This sort of life will never do for you! I must take you
out--introduce you--get you an <i>entr&eacute;e</i> into society,
before I leave Paris."</p>
<p>"I should be heartily glad to visit at one or two private
houses," I replied. "To spend the winter in this place without
knowing a soul, would be something frightful."</p>
<p>Dalrymple looked at me half laughingly, half
compassionately.</p>
<p>"Before I do it, however," said he, "you must look a little less
like a savage, and more like a tame Christian. You must have your
hair cut, and learn to tie your cravat properly. Do you possess an
evening suit?"</p>
<p>Blushing to the tips of my ears, I not only confessed that I was
destitute of that desirable outfit, but also that I had never yet
in all my life had occasion to wear it.</p>
<p>"I am glad of it; for now you are sure to be well fitted. Your
tailor, depend on it, is your great civilizer, and a well-made suit
of clothes is in itself a liberal education. I'll take you to
Michaud--my own especial purveyor. He is a great artist. With so
many yards of superfine black cloth, he will give you the tone of
good society and the exterior of a gentleman. In short, he will do
for you in eight or ten hours more than I could do in as many
years."</p>
<p>"Pray introduce me at once to this illustrious man," I exclaimed
laughingly, "and let me do him homage!"</p>
<p>"You will have to pay heavily for the honor," said Dalrymple.
"Of that I give you notice."</p>
<p>"No matter. I am willing to pay heavily for the tone of good
society and the exterior of a gentleman."</p>
<p>"Very good. Take a book, then, or a cigar, and amuse yourself
for five minutes while I write a note. That done, you may command
me for as long as you please."</p>
<p>I took the first book that came, and finding it to be a history
of the horse, amused myself, instead, by observing the aspect of
Dalrymple's apartment.</p>
<p>Rooms are eloquent biographies. They betray at once if the owner
be careless or orderly, studious or idle, vulgar or refined.
Flowers on the table, engravings on the walls, indicate refinement
and taste; while a well-filled book-case says more in favor of its
possessor than the most elaborate letter of recommendation.
Dalrymple's room was a monograph of himself. Careless, luxurious,
disorderly, crammed with all sorts of costly things, and
characterized by a sort of reckless elegance, it expressed, as I
interpreted it, the very history of the man. Rich hangings;
luxurious carpets; walls covered with paintings; cabinets of bronze
and rare porcelain; a statuette of Rachel beside a bust of Homer; a
book-case full of French novels with a sprinkling of Shakespeare
and Horace; a stand of foreign arms; a lamp from Pompeii; a silver
casket full of cigars; tables piled up with newspapers, letters,
pipes, riding-whips, faded bouquets, and all kinds of miscellaneous
rubbish--such were my friend's surroundings; and such, had I
speculated upon them beforehand, I should have expected to find
them. Dalrymple, in the meanwhile, despatched his letter with
characteristic rapidity. His pen rushed over the paper like a
dragoon charge, nor was once laid aside till both letter and
address were finished. Just as he was sealing it, a note was
brought to him by his servant--a slender, narrow, perfumed note,
written on creamy paper, and adorned on the envelope with an
elaborate cypher in gold and colors. Had I lived in the world of
society for the last hundred seasons, I could not have interpreted
the appearance of that note more sagaciously.</p>
<p>"It is from a lady," said I to myself. Then seeing Dalrymple
tear up his own letter immediately after reading it, and begin
another, I added, still in my own mind--"And it is from the lady to
whom he was writing."</p>
<p>Presently he paused, laid his pen aside, and said:--</p>
<p>"Arbuthnot, would you like to go with me to-morrow evening to
one or two <i>soir&eacute;es</i>?"</p>
<p>"Can your Civilizer provide me with my evening suit in
time?"</p>
<p>"He? The great Michaud? Why, he would equip you for this
evening, if it were necessary!"</p>
<p>"In that case, I shall be very glad."</p>
<p>"<i>Bon!</i> I will call for you at ten o'clock; so do not
forget to leave me your address."</p>
<p>Whereupon he resumed his letter. When it was written, he
returned to the subject.</p>
<p>"Then I will take you to-morrow night," said he, "to a reception
at Madame Rachel's. Hers is the most beautiful house in Paris. I
know fifty men who would give their ears to be admitted to her
<i>salons</i>."</p>
<p>Even in the wilds of Saxonholme I had heard and read of the
great <i>tragedienne</i> whose wealth vied with the Rothschilds,
and whose diamonds might have graced a crown. I had looked forward
to the probability of beholding her from afar off, if she was ever
to be seen on the boards of the Theatre Fran&ccedil;ais; but to be
admitted to her presence--received in her house--introduced to her
in person ... it seemed ever so much too good to be true!</p>
<p>Dalrymple smiled good-naturedly, and put my thanks aside.</p>
<p>"It is a great sight," said he, "and nothing more. She will bow
to you--she may not even speak; and she would pass you the next
morning without remembering that she had ever seen you in her life.
Actresses are a race apart, my dear fellow, and care for no one who
is neither rich nor famous."</p>
<p>"I never imagined," said I, half annoyed, "that she would take
any notice of me at all. Even a bow from such a woman is an event
to be remembered."</p>
<p>"Having received that bow, then," continued Dalrymple, "and
having enjoyed the ineffable satisfaction of returning it, you can
go on with me to the house of a lady close by, who receives every
Monday evening. At her <i>soir&eacute;es</i> you will meet pleasant
and refined people, and having been once introduced by me, you
will, I have no doubt, find the house open to you for the
future."</p>
<p>"That would, indeed, be a privilege. Who is this lady?"</p>
<p>"Her name," said Dalrymple, with an involuntary glance at the
little note upon his desk, "is Madame de Courcelles. She is a very
charming and accomplished lady."</p>
<p>I decided in my own mind that Madame de Courcelles was the
writer of that note.</p>
<p>"Is she married?" was my next question.</p>
<p>"She is a widow," replied Dalrymple. "Monsieur de Courcelles was
many years older than his wife, and held office as a cabinet
minister during the greater part of the reign of Louis Phillippe.
He has been dead these four or five years."</p>
<p>"Then she is rich?"</p>
<p>"No--not rich; but sufficiently independent."</p>
<p>"And handsome?"</p>
<p>"Not handsome, either; but graceful, and very fascinating."</p>
<p>Graceful, fascinating, independent, and a widow! Coupling these
facts with the correspondence which I believed I had detected, I
grouped them into a little romance, and laid out my friend's future
career as confidently as if it had depended only on myself to marry
him out of hand, and make all parties happy.</p>
<p>Dalrymple sat musing for a moment, with his chin resting on his
hands and his eyes fixed on the desk. Then shaking back his hair as
if he would shake back his thoughts with it, he started suddenly to
his feet and said, laughingly:--</p>
<p>"Now, young Damon, to Michaud's--to Michaud's, with what speed
we may! Farewell to 'Tempe and the vales of Arcady,' and hey for
civilization, and a swallow-tailed coat!"</p>
<p>I noticed, however, that before we left the room, he put the
little note tenderly away in a drawer of his desk, and locked it
with a tiny gold key that hung upon his watch-chain.</p>

<h3>I MAKE MY DEBUT IN SOCIETY.</h3>
<br>
<p>At ten o'clock on Monday evening, Dalrymple called for me, and
by ten o'clock, thanks to the great Michaud and other men of
genius, I presented a faultless exterior. My friend walked round me
with a candle, and then sat down and examined me critically.</p>
<p>"By Jove!" said he, "I don't believe I should have known you!
You are a living testimony to the science of tailoring. I shall
call on Michaud, to-morrow, and pay my tribute of admiration."</p>
<p>"I am very uncomfortable," said I, ruefully.</p>
<p>"Uncomfortable! nonsense--Michaud's customers don't know the
meaning of the word."</p>
<p>"But he has not made me a single pocket!"</p>
<p>"And what of that? Do you suppose the great Michaud would spoil
the fit of a masterpiece for your convenience?"</p>
<p>"What am I to do with my pocket-handkerchief?"</p>
<p>"Michaud's customers never need pocket-handkerchiefs."</p>
<p>"And then my trousers..."</p>
<p>"Unreasonable Juvenile, what of the trousers?"</p>
<p>"They are so tight that I dare not sit down in them."</p>
<p>"Barbarian! Michaud's customers never sit down in society."</p>
<p>"And my boots are so small that I can hardly endure them."</p>
<p>"Very becoming to the foot," said Dalyrmple, with exasperating
indifference.</p>
<p>"And my collar is so stiff that it almost cuts my throat."</p>
<p>"Makes you hold your head up," said Dalrymple, "and leaves you
no inducement to commit suicide."</p>
<p>I could not help laughing, despite my discomfort.</p>
<p>"Job himself never had such a comforter!" I exclaimed.</p>
<p>"It would be a downright pleasure to quarrel with you."</p>
<p>"Put on your hat instead, and let us delay no longer," replied
my friend. "My cab is waiting."</p>
<p>So we went down, and in another moment were driving through the
lighted streets. I should hardly have chosen to confess how my
heart beat when, on turning an angle of the Rue Trudon, our cab
fell into the rear of three or four other carriages, passed into a
courtyard crowded with arriving and departing vehicles, and drew up
before an open door, whence a broad stream of light flowed out to
meet us. A couple of footmen received us in a hall lighted by
torches and decorated with stands of antique armor. From the centre
of this hall sprang a Gothic staircase, so light, so richly
sculptured, so full of niches and statues, slender columns,
foliated capitals, and delicate ornamentation of every kind, that
it looked a very blossoming of the stone. Following Dalrymple up
this superb staircase and through a vestibule of carved oak, I next
found myself in a room that might have been the scene of Plato's
symposium. Here were walls painted in classic fresco; windows
curtained with draperies of chocolate and amber; chairs and couches
of ebony, carved in antique fashion; Etruscan amphorae; vases and
paterae of terracotta; exquisite lamps, statuettes and candelabra
in rare green bronze; and curious parti-colored busts of
philosophers and heroes, in all kinds of variegated marbles.
Powdered footmen serving modern coffee seemed here like
anachronisms in livery. In such a room one should have been waited
on by boys crowned with roses, and have partaken only of classic
dishes--of Venafran olives or oysters from the Lucrine lake, washed
down with Massic, or Chian, or honeyed Falernian.</p>
<p>Some half-dozen gentlemen, chatting over their coffee, bowed to
Dalrymple when we came in. They were talking of the war in Algiers,
and especially of the gallantry of a certain Vicomte de Caylus, in
whose deeds they seemed to take a more than ordinary interest.</p>
<p>"Rode single-handed right through the enemy's camp," said a
bronzed, elderly man, with a short, gray beard.</p>
<p>"And escaped without a scratch," added another, with a tiny red
ribbon at his button-hole.</p>
<p>"He comes of a gallant stock," said a third. "I remember his
father at Austerlitz--literally cut to pieces at the head of his
squadron."</p>
<p>"You are speaking of de Caylus," said Dalrymple. "What news of
him from Algiers?"</p>
<p>"This--that having volunteered to carry some important
despatches to head-quarters, he preferred riding by night through
Abd-el-Kader's camp, to taking a <i>d&eacute;tour</i> by the
mountains," replied the first speaker.</p>
<p>"A wild piece of boyish daring," said Dalrymple, somewhat drily.
"I presume he did not return by the same road?"</p>
<p>"I should think not. It would have been certain death a second
time!"</p>
<p>"And this happened how long since?"</p>
<p>"About a fortnight ago. But we shall soon know all particulars
from himself."</p>
<p>"From himself?"</p>
<p>"Yes, he has obtained leave of absence--is, perhaps, by this
time in Paris."</p>
<p>Dalrymple set down his cup untasted, and turned away.</p>
<p>"Come, Arbuthnot," he said, hastily, "I must introduce you to
Madame Rachel."</p>
<p>We passed through a small antechamber, and into a brilliant
<i>salon</i>, the very reverse of antique. Here all was light and
color. Here were hangings of flowered chintz; fantastic divans;
lounge-chairs of every conceivable shape and hue; great Indian
jars; richly framed drawings; stands of exotic plants; Chinese
cages, filled with valuable birds from distant climes; folios of
engravings; and, above all, a large cabinet in marqueterie, crowded
with bronzes, Chinese carvings, pastille burners, fans, medals,
Dresden groups, S&eacute;vres vases, Venetian glass, Asiatic idols,
and all kinds of precious trifles in tortoise-shall, mother
o'-pearl, malachite, onyx, lapis lazuli, jasper, ivory, and mosaic.
In this room, sitting, standing, turning over engravings, or
grouped here and there on sofas and divans, were some twenty-five
or thirty gentlemen, all busily engaged in conversation. Saluting
some of these by a passing bow, my friend led the way straight
through this <i>salon</i> and into a larger one immediately beyond
it.</p>
<p>"This," he said, "is one of the most beautiful rooms in Paris.
Look round and tell me if you recognise, among all her votaries,
the divinity herself."</p>
<p>I looked round, bewildered.</p>
<p>"Recognise!" I echoed. "I should not recognise my own father at
this moment. I feel like Abou Hassan in the palace of the
Caliph."</p>
<p>"Or like Christopher Sly, when he wakes in the nobleman's
bedchamber," said Dalrymple; "though I should ask your pardon for
the comparison. But see what it is to be an actress with forty-two
thousand francs of salary per week. See these panels painted by
Muller--this chandelier by Deni&eacute;re, of which no copy
exists--this bust of Napoleon by Canova--these hangings of purple
and gold--this ceiling all carved and gilded, than which Versailles
contains nothing more elaborate. <i>Allons donc</i>! have you
nothing to say in admiration of so much splendor?"</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>"What can I say? Is this the house of an actress, or the palace
of a prince? But stay--that pale woman yonder, all in white, with a
plain gold circlet on her head--who is she?"</p>
<p>"Ph&eacute;dre herself," replied Dalrymple. "Follow me, and be
introduced."</p>
<p>She was sitting in a large fauteuil of purple velvet. One foot
rested on a stool richly carved and gilt; one arm rested
negligently on a table covered with curious foreign weapons. In her
right hand she held a singular poignard, the blade of which was
damascened with gold, while the handle, made of bronze and
exquisitely modelled, represented a tiny human skeleton. With this
ghastly toy she kept playing as she spoke, apparently unconscious
of its grim significance. She was surrounded by some ten or a dozen
distinguished-looking men, most of whom were profusely
<i>d&eacute;cor&eacute;</i>. They made way courteously at our
approach. Dalrymple then presented me. I made my bow, was
graciously received, and dropped modestly into the rear.</p>
<p>"I began to think that Captain Dalrymple had forsworn Paris,"
said Rachel, still toying with the skeleton dagger. "It is surely a
year since I last had this pleasure?"</p>
<p>"Nay, Madame, you flatter me," said Dalrymple. "I have been
absent only five months."</p>
<p>"Then, you see, I have measured your absence by my loss."</p>
<p>Dalrymple bowed profoundly.</p>
<p>Rachel turned to a young man behind her chair.</p>
<p>"Monsieur le Prince," said she, "do you know what is rumored in
the <i>foyer</i> of the Francais? That you have offered me your
hand!"</p>
<p>"I offer you both my hands, in applause, Madame, every night of
your performance," replied the gentleman so addressed.</p>
<p>She smiled and made a feint at him with the dagger.</p>
<p>"Excellent!" said she. "One is not enough for a tragedian But
where is Alphonse Karr?"</p>
<p>"I have been looking for him all the evening," said a tall man,
with an iron-gray beard. "He told me he was coming; but authors are
capricious beings--the slaves of the pen."</p>
<p>"True; he lives by his pen--others die by it," said Rachel
bitterly. "By the way, has any one seen Scribe's new
Vaudeville?"</p>
<p>"I have," replied a bald little gentleman with a red and green
ribbon in his button-hole.</p>
<p>"And your verdict?"</p>
<p>"The plot is not ill-conceived; but Scribe is only godfather to
the piece. It is almost entirely written by Duverger, his
<i>collaborateur</i>."</p>
<p>"The life of a <i>collaborateur</i>," said Rachel, "is one long
act of self-abnegation. Another takes all the honor--he all the
labor. Thus soldiers fall, and their generals reap the glory."</p>
<p>"A <i>collaborateur</i>," said a cynical-looking man who had not
yet spoken, "is a hackney vehicle which one hires on the road to
fame, and dismisses at the end of the journey."</p>
<p>"Sometimes without paying the fare," added a gentleman who had
till now been examining, weapon by weapon, all the curious
poignards and pistols on the table. "But what is this singular
ornament?"</p>
<p>And he held up what appeared to be a large bone, perforated in
several places.</p>
<p>The bald little man with the red and green ribbon uttered an
exclamation of surprise.</p>
<p>"It is a tibia!" said he, examining it through his double
eye-glass.</p>
<p>"And what of that?" laughed Rachel. "Is it so wonderful to find
one leg in a collection of arms? However, not to puzzle you, I may
as well acknowledge that it was brought to me from Rome by a
learned Italian, and is a curious antique. The Romans made flutes
of the leg-bones of their enemies, and this is one of them."</p>
<p>"A melodious barbarism!" exclaimed one.</p>
<p>"Puts a 'stop,' at all events, to the enemy's flight!" said
another.</p>
<p>"Almost as good as drinking out of his skull," added a
third.</p>
<p>"Or as eating him, <i>tout de bon</i>," said Rachel.</p>
<p>"There must be a certain satisfaction in cannibalism," observed
the cynic who had spoken before. "There are people upon whom one
would sup willingly."</p>
<p>"As, for instance, critics, who are our natural enemies," said
Rachel. "<i>C'est &agrave; dire</i>, if critics were not too sour
to be eaten."</p>
<p>"Nay, with the sweet sauce of vengeance!"</p>
<p>"You speak feelingly, Monsieur de Musset. I am almost sorry, for
your sake, that cannibalism is out of fashion!"</p>
<p>"It is one of the penalties of civilization," replied de Musset,
with a shrug. "Besides, one would not wish to be an epicure."</p>
<p>Dalrymple, who had been listening somewhat disdainfully to this
skirmish of words, here touched me on the arm and turned away.</p>
<p>"Don't you hate this sort of high-pressure talk?" he said,
impatiently.</p>
<p>"I was just thinking it so brilliant."</p>
<p>"Pshaw!--conversational fireworks--every speaker bent on
eclipsing every other speaker. It's an artificial atmosphere, my
dear Damon--a sort of forcing-house for good things; and I hate
forced witticisms, as I hate forced peas. But have you had enough
of it? Or has this feast of reason taken away your appetite for
simpler fare?"</p>
<p>"If you mean, am I ready to go with you to Madame de
Courcelles'--yes."</p>
<p>"<i>A la bonne heure</i>!"</p>
<p>"But you are not going away without taking leave of Madame
Rachel?"</p>
<p>"Unquestionably. Leave-taking is a custom more honored in the
breach than the observance."</p>
<p>"But isn't that very impolite?"</p>
<p>"<i>Ing&eacute;nu!</i> Do you know that society ignores
everything disagreeable? A leave-taker sets an unpleasant example,
disturbs the harmony of things, and reminds others of their
watches. Besides, he suggests unwelcome possibilities. Perhaps he
finds the party dull; or, worse still, he may be going to one that
is pleasanter."</p>
<p>By this time we were again rattling along the Boulevard. The
theatres were ablaze with lights. The road was full of carriages.
The <i>trottoir</i> was almost as populous as at noon. The idlers
outside the <i>caf&eacute;s</i> were still eating their ices and
sipping their <i>eau-sucr&eacute;</i> as though, instead of being
past eleven at night, it was scarcely eleven in the morning. In a
few minutes, we had once more turned aside out of the great
thoroughfare, and stopped at a private house in a quiet street. A
carriage driving off, a cab drawing up behind our own, open windows
with drawn blinds, upon which were profiled passing shadows of the
guests within, and the ringing tones of a soprano voice,
accompanied by a piano, gave sufficient indication of a party, and
had served to attract a little crowd of soldiers and <i>gamins</i>
about the doorway.</p>
<p>Having left our over-coats with a servant, we were ushered
upstairs, and, as the song was not yet ended, slipped in
unannounced and stationed ourselves just between two crowded
drawing-rooms, where, sheltered by the folds of a muslin curtain,
we could see all that was going on in both. I observed, at a
glance, that I was now in a society altogether unlike that which I
had just left.</p>
<p>At Rachel's there were present only two ladies besides herself,
and those were members of her own family. Here I found at least an
equal proportion of both sexes. At Rachel's a princely magnificence
reigned. Here the rooms were elegant, but simple; the paintings
choice but few; the ornaments costly, but in no unnecessary
profusion.</p>
<p>"It is just the difference between taste and display," said
Dalrymple. "Rachel is an actress, and Madame de Courcelles is a
lady. Rachel exhibits her riches as an Indian chief exhibits the
scalps of his victims--Madame de Courcelles adorns her house with
no other view than to make it attractive to her friends."</p>
<p>"As a Greek girl covers her head with sequins to show the amount
of her fortune, and an English girl puts a rose in her hair for
grace and beauty only," said I, fancying that I had made rather a
clever observation. I was therefore considerably disappointed when
Dalrymple merely said, "just so."</p>
<p>The lady in the larger room here finished her song and returned
to her seat, amid a shower of <i>bravas</i>.</p>
<p>"She sings exquisitely," said I, following her with my eyes.</p>
<p>"And so she ought," replied my friend. "She is the Countess
Rossi, whom you may have heard of as Mademoiselle Sontag."</p>
<p>"What! the celebrated Sontag?" I exclaimed.</p>
<p>"The same. And the gentleman to whom she is now speaking is no
less famous a person than the author of <i>Pelham</i>."</p>
<p>I was as much delighted as a rustic at a menagerie, and
Dalrymple, seeing this, continued to point out one celebrity after
another till I began no longer to remember which was which. Thus
Lamartine, Horace Vernet, Scribe, Baron Humboldt, Miss Bremer,
Arago, Auber, and Sir Edwin Landseer, were successively indicated,
and I thought myself one of the most fortunate fellows in Paris,
only to be allowed to look upon them.</p>
<p>"I suppose the spirit of lion-hunting is an original instinct,"
I said, presently. "Call it vulgar excitement, if you will; but I
must confess that to see these people, and to be able to write
about them to my father, is just the most delightful thing that has
happened to me since I left home."</p>
<p>"Call things by their right names, Damon," said Dalrymple,
good-naturedly. "If you were a <i>parvenu</i> giving a party, and
wanted all these fine folks to be seen at your house, that would be
lion-hunting; but being whom and what you are, it is
hero-worship--a disease peculiar to the young; wholesome and
inevitable, like the measles."</p>
<p>"What have I done," said a charming voice close by, "that
Captain Dalrymple will not even deign to look upon me?"</p>
<p>The charming voice proceeded from the still more charming lips
of an exceedingly pretty brunette in a dress of light green silk,
fastened here and there with bouquets of rosebuds. Plump, rosy,
black-haired, bright-eyed, bewilderingly coquettish, this lady
might have been about thirty years of age, and seemed by no means
unconscious of her powers of fascination.</p>
<p>"I implore a thousand pardons, Madame...." began my friend.</p>
<p>"<i>Comment</i>! A thousand pardons for a single offence!"
exclaimed the lady. "What an unreasonable culprit!"</p>
<p>To which she added, quite audibly, though behind the temporary
shelter of her fan:--</p>
<p>"Who is this <i>beau gar&ccedil;on</i> whom you seem to have
brought with you?"</p>
<p>I turned aside, affecting not to hear the question; but could
not help listening, nevertheless. Of Dalrymple's reply, however, I
caught but my own name.</p>
<p>"So much the better," observed the lady. "I delight in
civilizing handsome boys. Introduce him."</p>
<p>Dalrymple tapped me on the arm.</p>
<p>"Madame de Marignan permits me to introduce you, <i>mon
ami</i>," said he. "Mr. Basil Arbuthnot--Madame de Marignan."</p>
<p>I bowed profoundly--all the more profoundly because I felt
myself blushing to the eyes, and would not for the universe have
been suspected of overhearing the preceding conversation; nor was
my timidity alleviated when Dalrymple announced his intention of
going in search of Madame de Courcelles, and of leaving me in the
care of Madame de Marignan.</p>
<p>"Now, Damon, make the most of your opportunities," whispered he,
as he passed by. "<i>Vogue la gal&egrave;re</i>!"</p>
<p><i>Vogue la gal&egrave;re</i>, indeed! As if I had anything to
do with the <i>gal&egrave;re</i>, except to sit down in it, the
most helpless of galley-slaves, and blindly submit to the gyves and
chains of Madame de Marignan, who, regarding me as the lawful
captive of her bow and spear, carried me off at once to a vacant
<i>causeuse</i> in a distant corner.</p>
<p>To send me in search of a footstool, to make me hold her fan, to
overwhelm me with questions and bewilder me with a thousand
coquetries, were the immediate proceedings of Madame de Marignan. A
consummate tactician, she succeeded, before a quarter of an hour
had gone by, in putting me at my ease, and in drawing from me
everything that I had to tell--all my past; all my prospects for
the future; the name and condition of my father; a description of
Saxonholme, and the very date of my birth. Then she criticized all
the ladies in the room, which only drew my attention more
admiringly upon herself; and she quizzed all the young men, whereby
I felt indirectly flattered, without exactly knowing why; and she
praised Dalrymple in terms for which I could have embraced her on
the spot had she been ten times less pretty, and ten times less
fascinating.</p>
<p>I was an easy victim, after all, and scarcely worth the powder
and shot of an experienced <i>franc-tireur;</i> but Madame de
Marignan, according to her own confession, had a taste for
civilizing "handsome boys," and as I may, perhaps, have come under
that category a good many years ago, the little victory amused her!
By the time, at all events, that Dalrymple returned to tell me it
was past one o'clock in the morning, and I must be introduced to
the mistress of the house before leaving, my head was as completely
turned as that of old Time himself.</p>
<p>"Past one!" I exclaimed. "Impossible! We cannot have been here
half-an hour."</p>
<p>At which neither Dalrymple nor Madame de Marignan could forbear
smiling.</p>
<p>"I hope our acquaintance is not to end here, monsieur," said
Madame de Marignan. "I live in the Rue Castellane, and am at home
to my friends every Wednesday evening."</p>
<p>I bowed almost to my boots.</p>
<p>"And to my intimates, every morning from twelve to two," she
added very softly, with a dimpled smile that went straight to my
heart, and set it beating like the paddle-wheels of a steamer.</p>
<p>I stammered some incoherent thanks, bowed again, nearly upset a
servant with a tray of ices, and, covered with confusion, followed
Dalrymple into the farther room. Here I was introduced to Madame de
Courcelles, a pale, aristocratic woman some few years younger than
Madame de Marignan, and received a gracious invitation to all her
Monday receptions. But I was much less interested in Madame de
Courcelles than I should have been a couple of hours before. I
scarcely looked at her, and five minutes after I was out of her
presence, could not have told whether she was fair or dark, if my
life had depended on it!</p>
<p>"What say you to walking home?" said Dalrymple, as we went down
stairs. "It is a superb night, and the fresh air would be
delightful after these hot rooms."</p>
<p>I assented gladly; so we dismissed the cab, and went out,
arm-in-arm, along a labyrinth of quiet streets lighted by gas-lamps
few and far between, and traversed only by a few homeward-bound
pedestrians. Emerging presently at the back of the Madeleine, we
paused for a moment to admire the noble building by moonlight; then
struck across the March&eacute; aux Fleurs and took our way along
the Boulevard.</p>
<p>"Are you tired, Damon?" said Dalrymple presently.</p>
<p>"Not in the least," I replied, with my head full of Madame de
Marignan.</p>
<p>"Would you like to look in at an artists' club close by here,
where I have the <i>entree?</i>--queer place enough, but amusing to
a stranger."</p>
<p>"Yes, very much."</p>
<p>"Come along, then; but first button up your overcoat to the
throat, and tie this colored scarf round your neck. See, I do the
same. Now take off your gloves--that's it. And give your hat the
least possible inclination to the left ear. You may turn up the
bottoms of your trousers, if you like--anything to look a little
slangy."</p>
<p>"Is that necessary?"</p>
<p>"Indispensable--at all events in the honorable society of <i>Les
Chicards."</i></p>
<p>"<i>Les Chicards</i>!" I repeated. "What are they?"</p>
<p>"It is the name of the club, and means--Heaven only knows what!
for Greek or Latin root it has none, and record of it there exists
not, unless in the dictionary of Arg&ocirc;t. And yet if you were
an old Parisian and had matriculated for the last dozen years at
the Bal de l'Op&eacute;ra, you would know the illustrious Chicard
by sight as familiarly as Punch, or Paul Pry, or Pierrot. He is a
gravely comic personage with a bandage over one eye, a battered hat
considerably inclining to the back of his head, a coat with a high
collar and long tails, and a <i>tout ensemble</i> indescribably
seedy--something between a street preacher and a travelling
showman. But here we are. Take care how you come down, and mind
your head."</p>
<p>Having turned aside some few minutes before into the Rue St.
Honor&eacute;, we had thence diverged down a narrow street with a
gutter running along the middle and no foot-pavements on either
side. The houses seemed to be nearly all shops, some few of which,
for the retailing of <i>charbonnerie</i>, stale vegetables,
uninviting cooked meats, and so forth, were still open; but that
before which we halted was closely shuttered up, with only a
private door open at the side, lighted by a single oil-lamp.
Following my friend for a couple of yards along the dim passage
within, I became aware of strange sounds, proceeding apparently
from the bowels of the earth, and found myself at the head of a
steep staircase, down which it was necessary to proceed with my
body bent almost double, in consequence of the close proximity of
the ceiling and the steps. At the foot of this staircase came
another dim passage and another oil-lamp over a low door, at which
Dalrymple paused a moment before entering. The sounds which I had
heard above now resolved themselves into their component parts,
consisting of roars of laughter, snatches of songs, clinkings of
glasses, and thumpings of bottles upon tables, to the accompaniment
of a deep bass hum of conversation, all of which prepared me to
find a very merry company within.</p>

<h3>THE HONORABLE SOCIETY OF LES CHICARDS.</h3>
<blockquote>"When a set of men find themselves agree in any
particular, though never so trivial, they establish themselves into
a kind of fraternity, and meet once or twice a
week."--<i>Spectator</i>.</blockquote>
<br>
<p>It was a long, low room lighted by gas, with a table reaching
from end to end. Round about this table, in various stages of
conviviality and conversation, were seated some thirty or forty
men, capped, bearded, and eccentric-looking, with all kinds of
queer blouses and wonderful heads of hair. Dropping into a couple
of vacant chairs at the lower end of this table, we called for a
bottle of Chablis, lit our cigars, and fell in with the general
business of the evening. At the top, dimly visible through a dense
fog of tobacco smoke, sat a stout man in a green coat fastened by a
belt round the waist. He was evidently the President, and, instead
of a hammer, had a small bugle lying by his side, which he blew
from time to time to enforce silence.</p>
<p>Somewhat perplexed by the general aspect of the club, I turned
to my companion for an explanation.</p>
<p>"Is it possible," I asked, "that these amazing individuals are
all artists and gentlemen?"</p>
<p>"Artists, every one," replied Dalrymple; "but as to their claim
to be gentlemen, I won't undertake to establish it. After all, the
<i>Chicards</i> are not first-rate men."</p>
<p>"What are they, then?"</p>
<p>"Oh, the Helots of the profession--hewers of wood engravings,
and drawers of water-colors, with a sprinkling of daguerreotypists,
and academy students. But hush--somebody is going to sing!"</p>
<p>And now, heralded by a convulsive flourish from the President's
bugle, a young <i>Chicard</i>, whose dilapidated outer man
sufficiently contradicted the burthen of his song, shouted with
better will than skill, a <i>chanson</i> of Beranger's, every verse
of which ended with:--</p>
<blockquote>"J'ai cinquante &eacute;cus,<br>
J'ai cinquante &eacute;cus,<br>
J'ai cinquante &eacute;cus de rente!"</blockquote>
<p>Having brought this performance to a satisfactory conclusion,
the singer sat down amid great clapping of hands and clattering of
glasses, and the President, with another flourish on the bugle,
called upon one Monsieur Tourterelle. Monsieur Tourterelle was a
tall, gaunt, swarthy personage, who appeared to have cultivated his
beard at the expense of his head, since the former reached nearly
to his waist, while the latter was as bare as a billiard-ball.
Preparing himself for the effort with a wine-glass full of raw
cognac, this gentleman leaned back in his chair, stuck his thumbs
into the armholes of his waistcoat, fixed his eyes on the ceiling,
and plunged at once into a doleful ballad about one Mademoiselle
Rosine, and a certain village <i>aupr&egrave;s de la mer</i>, which
seemed to be in an indefinite number of verses, and amused no one
but himself. In the midst of this ditty, just as the audience had
begun to testify their impatience by much whispering and shuffling
of feet, an elderly <i>Chicard</i>, with a very bald and shiny
head, was discovered to have fallen asleep in the seat next but one
to my own; whereupon my nearest neighbor, a merry-looking young
fellow with a profusion of rough light hair surmounted by a cap of
scarlet cloth, forthwith charred a cork in one of the candles, and
decorated the bald head of the sleeper with a comic countenance and
a pair of huge mustachios. An uproarious burst of laughter was the
immediate result, and the singer, interrupted somewhere about his
18th verse, subsided into offended silence.</p>
<p>"Monsieur M&uuml;ller is requested to favor the honorable
society with a song," cried the President, as soon as the tumult
had somewhat subsided.</p>
<p>My red-capped neighbor, answering to that name, begged to be
excused, on the score of having pledged his <i>ut de poitrine</i> a
week since at the Mont de Pi&eacute;t&eacute;, without yet having
been able to redeem it. This apology was received with laughter,
hisses, and general incredulity.</p>
<p>"But," he added, "I am willing to relate an adventure that
happened to myself in Rome two winters ago, if my honorable brother
<i>Chicards</i> will be pleased to hear it."</p>
<p>An immense burst of approbation from all but Monsieur
Tourterelle and the bald sleeper, followed this announcement; and
so, after a preliminary <i>grog au vin</i>, and another explosive
demonstration on the part of the chairman, Monsieur M&uuml;ller
thus began:--</p>

<br>
<br>
<h3>THE STUDENT'S STORY.</h3>
<br>
<p>"When I was in Rome, I lodged in the Via Margutta, which, for
the benefit of those who have not been there, may be described as a
street of studios and stables, crossed at one end by a little
roofed gallery with a single window, like a shabby 'Bridge of
Sighs,' A gutter runs down the middle, interrupted occasionally by
heaps of stable-litter; and the perspective is damaged by rows of
linen suspended across the street at uncertain intervals. The
houses in this agreeable thoroughfare are dingy, dilapidated, and
comfortless, and all which are not in use as stables, are occupied
by artists. However, it was a very jolly place, and I never was
happier anywhere in my life. I had but just touched my little
patrimony, and I was acquainted with plenty of pleasant fellows who
used to come down to my rooms at night from the French Academy
where they had been studying all day. Ah, what evenings those were!
What suppers we used to have in from the <i>Lepre</i>! What lots of
Orvieto we drank! And what a mountain of empty wicker bottles had
to be cleared away from the little square yard with the solitary
lemon-tree at the back of the house!"</p>
<p>"Come, M&uuml;ller--no fond memories!" cried a student in a
holland blouse. "Get on with the story."</p>
<p>"Ay, get on with the story!" echoed several voices.</p>
<p>To which M&uuml;ller, who took advantage of the interruption to
finish his <i>grog au vin</i>, deigned no reply.</p>
<p>"Well," he continued, "like a good many other fellows who,
having everything to learn and nothing to do, fancy themselves
great geniuses only because they are in Rome, I put a grand brass
plate on the door, testifying to all passers-by that mine was the
STUDIO DI HERR FRANZ MULLER; and, having done this, I believed, of
course, that my fortune was to be made out of hand. Nothing came of
it, however. People in search of Dessoulavy's rooms knocked
occasionally to ask their way, and a few English and Americans
dropped in from time to time to stare about them, after the
free-and-easy fashion of foreigners in Rome; but, for all this, I
found no patrons. Thus several months went by, during which I
studied from the life, worked hard at the antique, and relieved the
monotony of study with occasional trips to Frascati, or supper
parties at the Caf&eacute; Greco."</p>
<p>"The story! the story!" interrupted a dozen impatient
voices.</p>
<p>"All in good time," said M&uuml;ller, with provoking
indifference. "We are now coming to it."</p>
<p>And assuming an attitude expressive of mystery, he dropped his
voice, looked round the table, and proceeded:--</p>
<p>"It was on the last evening of the Carnival. It had been raining
at intervals during the day, but held up for a good hour just at
dusk, as if on purpose for the <i>moccoli</i>. Scarcely, however,
had the guns of St. Angelo thundered an end to the frolic, when the
rain came down again in torrents, and put out the last tapers that
yet lingered along the Corso. Wet, weary, and splashed from head to
foot with mud and tallow, I came home about seven o'clock, having
to dine and dress before going to a masked-ball in the evening. To
light my stove, change my wet clothes, and make the best of a
half-cold <i>trattore</i> dinner, were my first proceedings; after
which, I laid out my costume ready to put on, wrapped myself in a
huge cloak, swallowed a tumbler full of hot cognac and water, and
lay down in front of the fire, determined to have a sound nap and a
thorough warming, before venturing out again that night. I fell
asleep, of course, and never woke till roused by a tremendous peal
upon the studio-bell, about two hours and a half afterwards. More
dead than alive, I started to my feet. The fire had gone out in the
stove; the room was in utter darkness; and the bell still pealed
loud enough to raise the neighborhood.</p>
<p>"'Who's there?' I said, half-opening the door, through which the
wind and rain came rushing. 'And what, in the name of ten thousand
devils, do you want?"</p>
<p>"'I want an artist,' said my visitor, in Italian. 'Are you
one?'</p>
<p>"'I flatter myself that I am,' replied I, still holding the door
tolerably close.</p>
<p>"'Can you paint heads?'</p>
<p>"'Heads, figures, landscapes--anything,' said I, with my teeth
chattering like castanets.</p>
<p>"The stranger pushed the door open, walked in without further
ceremony, closed it behind him, and said, in a low, distinct
voice:--</p>
<p>"'Could you take the portrait of a dead man?'</p>
<p>"'Of a dead man?' I stammered. 'I--I ... Suppose I strike a
light?'</p>
<p>"The stranger laid his hand upon my arm.</p>
<p>"'Not till you have given me an answer,' said he. 'Yes or no?
Remember, you will be paid well for your work.'</p>
<p>"'Well, then--yes,' I replied.</p>
<p>"'And can you do it at once?'</p>
<p>"'At once?'</p>
<p>"'Ay, Signore, will you bring your colors, and come with me this
instant--or must I seek some other painter?'</p>
<p>"I thought of the masked-ball, and sighed; but the promise of
good payment, and, above all, the peculiarity of the adventure
determined me.</p>
<p>"'Nay, if it is to be done,' said I, 'one time is as good as
another. Let me strike a light, and I will at once pack up my
colors and come with you.'</p>
<p>"'<i>Bene</i>!' said the stranger. 'But be as quick as you can,
Signore, for time presses.'</p>
<p>"I was quick, you may be sure, and yet not so quick but that I
found time to look at my strange visitor. He was a dark, elderly
man, dressed in a suit of plain black, and might have been a clerk,
or a tradesman, or a confidential servant. As soon as I was ready,
he took the lead; conducted me to a carriage which was waiting at
the corner of a neighboring street; took his place respectfully on
the opposite seat; pulled down both the blinds, and gave the word
to drive on. I never knew by what streets we went, or to what part
of Rome he took me; but the way seemed long and intricate. At
length, we stopped and alighted. The night was pitch-dark, and
still stormy. I saw before me only the outline of a large building,
indistinct and gloomy, and a small open door dimly lighted-from
within. Hurried across the strip of narrow pavement, and shut in
immediately, I had no time to identify localities--no choice,
except to follow my conductor and blindly pursue the adventure to
its close. Having entered by a back door, we went up and down a
labyrinth of staircases and passages, for the mere purpose, as it
seemed, of bewildering me as much as possible--then paused before
an oaken door at the end of the corridor. Here my conductor
signified by a gesture that I was to precede him.</p>
<p>"It was a large, panelled chamber, richly furnished. A wood fire
smouldered on the hearth--a curtained alcove to the left partly
concealed a bed--a corresponding alcove to the right, fitted with
altar and crucifix, served as an oratory. In the centre of the room
stood a table covered with a cloth. It needed no second glance to
tell me what object lay beneath that cloth, uplifting it in ghastly
outline! My conductor pointed to the table, and asked if there was
anything I needed. To this I replied that I must have more light
and more fire, and so proceeded to disembarrass myself of my cloak,
and prepare my palette. In the meantime, he threw on a log and some
pine-cones, and went to fetch an additional lamp.</p>
<p>"Left alone with the body and impelled by an irresistible
impulse, I rolled back the cloth and saw before me the corpse of a
young man in fancy dress--a magnificent fellow cast in the very
mould of strength and grace, and measuring his six feet, if an
inch. The features were singularly handsome; the brow open and
resolute; the hair dark, and crisp with curls. Looking more
closely, I saw that a lock had been lately cut from the right
temple, and found one of the severed hairs upon the cheek, where it
had fallen. The dress was that of a jester of the middle ages, half
scarlet and half white, with a rich belt round the waist. In this
belt, as if in horrible mockery of the dead, was stuck a tiny baton
surmounted by a fool's cap, and hung with silver bells. Looking
down thus upon the body--so young, so beautiful, so evidently
unprepared for death--a conviction of foul play flashed upon me
with all the suddenness and certainty of revelation. Here were no
appearances of disease and no signs of strife. The expression was
not that of a man who had fallen weapon in hand. Neither, however,
was it that of one who had died in the agony of poison. The longer
I looked, the more mysterious it seemed; yet the more I felt
assured that there was guilt at the bottom of the mystery.</p>
<p>"While I was yet under the first confused and shuddering
impression of this doubt, my guide came back with a powerful solar
lamp, and, seeing me stand beside the body, said sharply:--</p>
<p>"'Well, Signore, you look as if you had never seen a dead man
before in all your life!'</p>
<p>"'I have seen plenty,' I replied, 'but never one so young, and
so handsome.'</p>
<p>"'He dropped down quite suddenly,' said he, volunteering the
information, 'and died in a few minutes. 'Then finding that I
remained silent, added:--</p>
<p>"'But I am told that it is always so in cases of
heart-disease.'</p>
<p>"'I turned away without replying, and, having placed the lamp to
my satisfaction, began rapidly sketching in my subject. My
instructions were simple. I was to give the head only; to produce
as rapid an effect with as little labor as possible; to alter
nothing; to add nothing; and, above all, to be ready to leave the
house before daybreak. So I set steadily to work, and my conductor,
establishing himself in an easy-chair by the fire, watched my
progress for some time, and then, as the night advanced, fell
profoundly asleep. Thus, hour after hour went by, and, absorbed in
my work, I painted on, unconscious of fatigue-- might almost say
with something of a morbid pleasure in the task before me. The
silence within; the raving of the wind and rain without; the solemn
mystery of death, and the still more solemn mystery of crime which,
as I followed out train after train of wild conjectures, grew to
still deeper conviction, had each and all their own gloomy
fascination. Was it not possible, I asked myself, by mere force of
will to penetrate the secret? Was it not possible to study that
dead face till the springs of thought so lately stilled within the
stricken brain should vibrate once more, if only for an instant, as
wire vibrates to wire, and sound to sound! Could I not, by long
studying of the passive mouth, compel some sympathetic revelation
of the last word that it uttered, though that revelation took no
outward form, and were communicable to the apprehension only?
Pondering thus, I lost myself in a labyrinth of fantastic reveries,
till the hand and the brain worked independently of each other--the
one swiftly reproducing upon canvas the outer lineaments of the
dead; the other laboring to retrace foregone facts of which no
palpable evidence remained. Thus my work progressed; thus the night
waned; thus the sleeper by the fireside stirred from time to time,
or moaned at intervals in his dreams.</p>
<p>"At length, when many hours had gone by, and I began to be
conscious of the first languor of sleeplessness, I heard, or
fancied I heard, a light sound in the corridor without. I held my
breath, and listened. As I listened, it ceased--was renewed--drew
nearer--paused outside the door. Involuntarily, I rose and looked
round for some means of defence, in case of need. Was I brought
here to perpetuate the record of a crime, and was I, when my task
was done, to be silenced in a dungeon, or a grave? This thought
flashed upon me almost before I was conscious of the horror it
involved. At the same moment, I saw the handle of the door turned
slowly and cautiously--then held back--and then, after a brief
pause, the door itself gradually opening."</p>
<p>Here the student paused as if overcome by the recollection of
that moment, and passed his hand nervously across his brow. I took
the liberty of pushing our bottle of Chablis towards him, for which
he thanked me with a nod and a smile, and filled his glass to the
brim.</p>
<p>"Well?" cried two or three voices eagerly; my own being one of
them. "The door opened--what then?"</p>
<p>"And a lady entered," he continued. "A lady dressed in black
from head to foot, with a small lamp in her hand. Seeing me, she
laid her finger significantly on her lip, closed the door as
cautiously as she had opened it, and, with the faltering, uncertain
steps of one just risen from a sick-bed, came over to where I had
been sitting, and leaned for support against my chair. She was very
pale, very calm, very young and beautiful, with just that look of
passive despair in her face that one sees in Guido's portrait of
Beatrice Cenci. Standing thus, I observed that she kept her eyes
turned from the corpse, and her attention concentrated on the
portrait. So several minutes passed, and neither of us spoke nor
stirred. Then, slowly, shudderingly, she turned, grasped me by the
arm, pointed to the dead form stretched upon the table, and less
with her breath than by the motion of her lips, shaped out the one
word:--'<i>Murdered</i>!'</p>
<p>"Stunned by this confirmation of my doubts, I could only clasp
my hands in mute horror, and stare helplessly from the lady to the
corpse, from the corpse to the sleeper. Wildly, feverishly, with
all her calmness turned to eager haste, she then bent over the
body, tore open the rich doublet, turned back the shirt, and,
without uttering one syllable, pointed to a tiny puncture just
above the region of the heart--a spot so small, so insignificant,
such a mere speck upon the marble, that but for the pale violet
discoloration which spread round it like a halo, I could scarcely
have believed it to be the cause of death. The wound had evidently
bled inwardly, and, being inflicted with some singularly slender
weapon, had closed again so completely as to leave an aperture no
larger than might have been caused by the prick of a needle. While
I was yet examining it, the fire fell together, and my conductor
stirred uneasily in his sleep. To cover the body hastily with the
cloth and resume my seat, was, with me, the instinctive work of a
moment; but he was quiet again the next instant, and breathing
heavily. With trembling hands, my visitor next re-closed the shirt
and doublet, replaced the outer covering, and bending down till her
lips almost touched my ear, whispered:--</p>
<p>"'You have seen it. If called upon to do so, will you swear
it?'</p>
<p>"I promised.</p>
<p>"'You will not let yourself be intimidated by threats? nor
bribed by gold? nor lured by promises?</p>
<p>"'Never, so help me Heaven!'</p>
<p>"She looked into my eyes, as if she would read my very soul;
then, before I knew what she was about to do, seized my hand, and
pressed it to her lip.</p>
<p>"'I believe you,' she said. 'I believe, and I thank you. Not a
word to him that you have seen me'--here she pointed to the sleeper
by the fire. 'He is faithful; but not to my interests alone. I dare
tell you no more--at all events, not now. Heaven bless and reward
you. In this portrait you give me the only treasure--the only
consolation of my future life!'</p>
<p>"So saying, she took a ring from her finger, pressed it, without
another word, into my unwilling hand; and, with the same passive
dreary look that her face had worn on first entering took up her
lamp again, and glided from the room.</p>
<p>"How the next hour, or half hour, went by, I know not--except
that I sat before the canvas like one dreaming. Now and then I
added a few touches; but mechanically, and, as it were, in a trance
of wonder and dismay. I had, however, made such good progress
before being interrupted, that when my companion woke and told me
it would soon be day and I must make haste to be gone, the portrait
was even more finished than I had myself hoped to make it in the
time. So I packed up my colors and palette again, and, while I was
doing so, observed that he not only drew the cloth once more over
the features of the dead, but concealed the likeness behind the
altar in the oratory, and even restored the chairs to their old
positions against the wall. This done, he extinguished the solar
lamp; put it out of sight; desired me once more to follow him; and
led the way back along the same labyrinth of staircases and
corridors by which he brought me. It was gray dawn as he hurried me
into the coach. The blinds were already down--the door was
instantly closed--again we seemed to be going through an infinite
number of streets--again we stopped, and I found myself at the
corner of the Via Margutta.</p>
<p>"'Alight, Signore,' said the stranger, speaking for the first
time since we started. 'Alight--you are but a few yards from your
own door. Here are a hundred scudi; and all that you have now to
do, is to forget your night's work, as if it had never been.'</p>
<p>"With this he closed the carriage-door, the horses dashed on
again, and, before I had time even to see if any arms were blazoned
on the panels, the whole equipage had disappeared.</p>
<p>"And here, strange to say, the adventure ended. I never was
called upon for evidence. I never saw anything more of the
stranger, or the lady. I never heard of any sudden death, or
accident, or disappearance having taken place about that time; and
I never even obtained any clue to the neighborhood of the house in
which these things took place. Often and often afterwards, when I
was strolling by night along the streets of Rome, I lingered before
some old palazzo, and fancied that I recognised the gloomy outline
that caught my eye in that hurried transit from the carriage to the
house. Often and often I paused and started, thinking that I had
found at last the very side-door by which I entered. But these were
mere guesses after all. Perhaps that house stood in some remote
quarter of the city where my footsteps never went again--perhaps in
some neighboring street or piazza, where I passed it every day! At
all events, the whole thing vanished like a dream, and, but for the
ring and the hundred scudi, a dream I should by this time believe
it to have been. The scudi, I am sorry to say, were spent within a
month--the ring I have never parted from, and here it is."</p>
<p>Hereupon the student took from his finger a superb ruby set
between two brilliants of inferior size, and allowed it to pass
from hand to hand, all round the table. Exclamations of surprise
and admiration, accompanied by all sorts of conjectures and
comments, broke from every lip.</p>
<p>"The dead man was the lady's lover," said one. "That is why she
wanted his portrait."</p>
<p>"Of course, and her husband had murdered him," said another.</p>
<p>"Who, then, was the man in black?" asked a third.</p>
<p>"A servant, to be sure. She said, if you remember, that he was
faithful; but not devoted to her interests alone. That meant that
he would obey to the extent of procuring for her the portrait of
her lover; but that he did not choose to betray his master, even
though his master was a murderer."</p>
<p>"But if so, where was the master?" said the first speaker. "Is
it likely that he would have neglected to conceal the body during
all these hours?"</p>
<p>"Certainly. Nothing more likely, if he were a man of the world,
and knew how to play his game out boldly to the end. Have we not
been told that it was the last night of the Carnival, and what
better could he do, to avert suspicion, than show himself at as
many balls as he could visit in the course of the evening? But
really, this ring is magnificent!"</p>
<p>"Superb. The ruby alone must be worth a thousand francs."</p>
<p>"To say nothing of the diamonds, and the setting," observed the
next to whom it was handed.</p>
<p>At length, after having gone nearly the round of the table, the
ring came to a little dark, sagacious-looking man, just one seat
beyond Dalrymple's, who peered at it suspiciously on every side,
breathed upon it, rubbed it bright again upon his coat-sleeve, and,
finally, held the stones up sideways between his eyes and the
light.</p>
<p>"Bah!" said he, sending it on with a contemptuous fillip of the
forefinger and thumb. "Glass and paste, <i>mon ami</i>. Not worth
five francs of anybody's money."</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller, who had been eyeing him all the time with an odd
smile lurking about the corners of his mouth, emptied his last drop
of Chablis, turned the glass over on the table, bottom upwards, and
said very coolly:--</p>
<p>"Well, I'm sorry for that; because I gave seven francs for it
myself this morning, in the Palais Royal."</p>
<p>"You!"</p>
<p>"Seven francs!"</p>
<p>"Bought in the Palais Royal!"</p>
<p>"What does he mean?"</p>
<p>"Mean?" echoed the student, in reply to this chorus of
exclamations. "I mean that I bought it this morning, and gave seven
francs for it. It is not every morning of my life, let me tell you,
that I have seven francs to throw away on my personal
appearance."</p>
<p>"But then the ring that the lady took from her finger?"</p>
<p>"And the murder?"</p>
<p>"And the servant in black?"</p>
<p>"And the hundred scudi?"</p>
<p>"One great invention from beginning to end, Messieurs les
Chicards, and being got up expressly for your amusement, I hope you
liked it. <i>Gar&ccedil;on?</i>--another <i>grog au vin</i>, and
sweeter than the last!"</p>
<p>It would be difficult to say whether the Chicards were most
disappointed or delighted at this
<i>d&eacute;no&ucirc;ment</i>--disappointed at its want of fact, or
delighted with the story-weaving power of Herr Franz M&uuml;ller.
They expressed themselves, at all events, with a tumultuous burst
of applause, in the midst of which we rose and left the room. When
we once more came out into the open air, the stars had disappeared
and the air was heavy with the damps of approaching daybreak.
Fortunately, we caught an empty <i>fiacre</i> in the next street
and, as we were nearer the Rue du Faubourg Montmartre than the
Chauss&eacute;e d' Antin, Dalrymple set me down first.</p>
<p>"Adieu, Damon," he said, laughingly, as we shook hands through
the window. "If we don't meet before, come and dine with me next
Sunday at seven o'clock--and don't dream of dreadful murders, if
you can help it!"</p>
<p>I did not dream of dreadful murders. I dreamt, instead, of
Madame de Marignan, and never woke the next morning till eleven
o'clock, just two hours later than the time at which I should have
presented myself at Dr. Ch&eacute;ron's.</p>

<h3>WHAT IT IS TO BE A CAVALIERE SERVENTE.</h3>
<center>"Everye white will have its blacke,<br>
And everye sweet its sowere."<br>
<br>
<i>Old Ballad</i>.</center>
<br>
<p>Neither the example of Oscar Dalrymple nor the broadcloth of the
great Michaud, achieved half so much for my education as did the
apprenticeship I was destined to serve to Madame de Marignan.
Having once made up her mind to civilize me, she spared no pains
for the accomplishment of that end, cost what it might to
herself--or me. Before I had been for one week her subject, she
taught me how to bow; how to pick up a pocket-handkerchief; how to
present a bouquet; how to hold a fan; how to pay a compliment; how
to turn over the leaves of a music-book--in short, how to obey and
anticipate every imperious wish; and how to fetch and carry, like a
dog. My vassalage began from the very day when I first ventured to
call upon her. Her house was small, but very elegant, and she
received me in a delicious little room overlooking the Champs
Elys&eacute;es--a very nest of flowers, books, and birds. Before I
had breathed the air of that fatal boudoir for one quarter of an
hour, I was as abjectly her slave as the poodle with the
rose-colored collar which lay curled upon a velvet cushion at her
feet.</p>
<p>"I shall elect you my <i>cavaliere servente</i>," said she,
after I had twice nervously risen to take my leave within the first
half hour, and twice been desired to remain a little longer. "Will
you accept the office?"</p>
<p>I thought it the greatest privilege under heaven. Perhaps I said
so.</p>
<p>"The duties of the situation are onerous," added she, "and I
ought not to accept your allegiance without setting them before
you. In the first place, you will have to bring me every new novel
of George Sand, Flaubert, or About, on the day of publication."</p>
<p>"I will move heaven and earth to get them the day before, if
that be all!" I exclaimed.</p>
<p>Madame de Marignan nodded approvingly, and went on telling off
my duties, one by one, upon her pretty fingers.</p>
<p>"You will have to accompany me to the Opera at least twice a
week, on which occasions you will bring me a bouquet--camellias
being my favorite flowers."</p>
<p>"Were they the flowers that bloom but once in a century," said
I, with more enthusiasm than sense, "they should be yours!"</p>
<p>Madame de Marignan smiled and nodded again.</p>
<p>"When I drive in the Bois, you will sometimes take a seat in my
carriage, and sometimes ride beside it, like an attentive
cavalier."</p>
<p>I was just about to avow that I had no horse, when I remembered
that I could borrow Dalrymple's, or hire one, if necessary; so I
checked myself, and bowed.</p>
<p>"When I go to an exhibition," said Madame de Marignan, "it will
be your business to look out the pictures in the catalogue--when I
walk, you will carry my parasol--when I go into a shop, you will
take care of my dog--when I embroider, you will wind off my silks,
and look for my scissors--when I want amusement, you must make me
laugh--and when I am sleepy, you must read to me. In short, my
<i>cavaliere servente</i> must be my shadow."</p>
<p>"Then, like your shadow, Madame," said I, "his place is ever at
your feet, and that is all I desire!"</p>
<p>Madame de Marignan laughed outright, and showed the loveliest
little double row of pearls in all the world.</p>
<p>"Admirable!" said she. "Quite an elegant compliment, and worthy
of an accomplished lady-killer! <i>Allons</i>! you are a promising
scholar."</p>
<p>"In all that I have dared to say, Madame, I am, at least,
sincere," I added, abashed by the kind of praise.</p>
<p>"Sincere? Of course you are sincere. Who ever doubted it? Nay,
to blush like that is enough to spoil the finest compliment in the
world. There--it is three o'clock, and at half-past I have an
engagement, for which I must now make my <i>toilette</i>. Come
to-morrow evening to my box at the <i>Italiens</i>, and so adieu.
Stay--being my <i>cavaliere</i>, I permit you, at parting, to kiss
my hand."</p>
<p>Trembling, breathless, scarcely daring to touch it with mine, I
lifted the soft little hand to my lips, stammered something which
was, no doubt, sufficiently foolish, and hurried away, as if I were
treading on air and breathing sunshine.</p>
<p>All the rest of that day went by in a kind of agreeable
delirium. I walked about, almost without knowledge where I went. I
talked, without exactly knowing what I said. I have some
recollection of marching to and fro among the side-alleys of the
Bois de Boulogne, which at that time was really a woody park, and
not a pleasure-garden--of lying under a tree, and listening to the
birds overhead, and indulging myself in some idiotic romance about
love, and solitude, and Madame de Marignan--of wandering into a
<i>restaurant</i> somewhere about seven o'clock, and sitting down
to a dinner for which I had no appetite--of going back, sometime
during the evening, to the Rue Castellane, and walking to and fro
on the opposite side of the way, looking up for ever so long at the
darkened windows where my divinity did not show herself--of coming
back to my lodgings, weary, dusty, and not a bit more sober,
somewhere about eleven o'clock at night, driven to-bed by sheer
fatigue, and, even then, too much in love to go to sleep!</p>
<p>The next day I went through my duties at Dr. Ch&eacute;ron's,
and attended an afternoon lecture at the hospital; but
mechanically, like one dreaming. In the evening I presented myself
at the Opera, where Madame de Marignan received me very graciously,
and deigned to accept a superb bouquet for which I had paid sixteen
francs. I found her surrounded by elegant men, who looked upon me
as nobody, and treated me accordingly. Driven to the back of the
box where I could neither speak to her, nor see the stage, nor
achieve even a glimpse of the house, I spent an evening which
certainly fell short of my anticipations. I had, however, the
gratification of seeing my bouquet thrown to Grisi at the end of
the second act, and was permitted the privilege of going in search
of Madame de Marignan's carriage, while somebody else handed her
downstairs, and assisted her with her cloak. A whispered word of
thanks, a tiny pressure of the hand, and the words "come early
to-morrow," compensated me, nevertheless, for every disappointment,
and sent me home as blindly happy as ever.</p>
<p>The next day I called upon her, according to command, and was
transported to the seventh heaven by receiving permission to
accompany her to a morning concert, whereby I missed two lectures,
and spent ten francs.</p>
<p>On the Sunday, having hired a good horse for the occasion, I had
the honor of riding beside her carriage till some better-mounted
acquaintance came to usurp my place and her attention; after which
I was forced to drop behind and bear the eclipse of my glory as
philosophically as I could.</p>
<p>Thus day after day went by, and, for the delusive sake of Madame
de Marignan's bright eyes, I neglected my studies, spent my money,
wasted my time, and incurred the displeasure of Dr. Ch&eacute;ron.
Led on from folly to folly, I was perpetually buoyed up by
coquetries which meant nothing, and as perpetually mortified,
disappointed, and neglected. I hoped; I feared; I fretted; I lost
my sleep and my appetite; I felt dissatisfied with all the world,
sometimes blaming myself, and sometimes her--yet ready to excuse
and forgive her at a moment's notice. A boy in experience even more
than in years, I loved with a boy's headlong passion, and suffered
with all a boy's acute susceptibility. I was intensely
sensitive--abashed by a slight, humbled by a glance, and so easily
wounded that there were often times when, seeing myself forgotten,
I could with difficulty drive back the tears that kept rising to my
eyes. On the other hand, I was as easily elated. A kind word, an
encouraging smile, a lingering touch upon my sleeve, was enough at
any time to make me forget all my foregone troubles. How often the
mere gift of a flower sent me home rejoicing! How the tiniest show
of preference set my heart beating! How proud I was if mine was the
arm chosen to lead her to her carriage! How more than happy, if
allowed for even one half-hour in the whole evening to occupy the
seat beside her own! To dangle after her the whole day long--to
traverse all Paris on her errands--to wait upon her pleasure like a
slave, and this, too, without even expecting to be thanked for my
devotion, seemed the most natural thing in the world. She was
capricious; but caprice became her. She was exacting; but her
exactions were so coquettish and attractive, that one would not
have wished her more reasonable. She was, at least, ten or twelve
years my senior; but boys proverbially fall in love with women
older than themselves, and this one was in all respects so
charming, that I do not, even now, wonder at my infatuation.</p>
<p>After all, there are few things under heaven more beautiful, or
more touching, than a boy's first love.</p>
<p>Passionate is it as a man's--pure as a woman's--trusting as a
child's--timid, through the very excess of its
unselfishness--chivalrous, as though handed down direct from the
days of old romance--poetical beyond the utterances of the poet. To
the boy-lover, his mistress is only something less than a divinity.
He believes in her truth as in his own; in her purity, as in the
sun at noon. Her practised arts of voice and manner are, in his
eyes, the unstudied graces that spring as naturally from her beauty
as the scent from the flower. Single-hearted himself, it seems
impossible that she whom he adores should trifle with the most
sacred sentiment he has ever known. Conscious of his own devotion,
he cannot conceive that his wealth is poured forth in vain, and
that he is but the plaything of her idle hours. Yet it is so. The
boy's first love is almost always misplaced; seldom rated at its
true value; hardly ever productive of anything but disappointment.
Aspirant of the highest mysteries of the soul, he passes through
the ordeal of fire and tears, happy if he keep his faith unshaken
and his heart pure, for the wiser worship hereafter. We all know
this; and few know it better than myself. Yet, with all its
suffering, which of us would choose to obliterate all record of his
first romance? Which of us would be without the memory of its
smiles and tears, its sunshine and its clouds? Not I for one.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI."></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<h3>A CONTRETEMPS IN A CARRIAGE.</h3>
<br>
<p>My slavery lasted somewhat longer than three weeks, and less
than a month; and was brought, oddly enough, to an abrupt
conclusion. This was how it happened.</p>
<p>I had, as usual, attended Madame de Marignan one evening to the
Opera, and found myself, also as usual, neglected for a host of
others. There was one man in particular whom I hated, and whom
(perhaps because I hated him) she distinguished rather more than
the rest. His name was Delaroche, and he called himself Monsieur le
Comte Delaroche. Most likely he was a Count---I have no reason to
doubt his title; but I chose to doubt it for mere spite, and
because he was loud and conceited, and wore a little red and green
ribbon in his button-hole. He had, besides, an offensive sense of
my youth and his own superiority, which I have never forgiven to
this day. On the particular occasion of which I am now speaking,
this person had made his appearance in Madame de Marignan's box at
the close of the first act, established himself in the seat behind
hers, and there held the lists against all comers during the
remainder of the evening. Everything he said, everything he did,
aggravated me. When he looked through her lorgnette, I loathed him.
When he admired her fan, I longed to thrust it down his throat.
When he held her bouquet to his odious nose (the bouquet that I had
given her!) I felt it would have been justifiable manslaughter to
take him up bodily, and pitch him over into the pit.</p>
<p>At length the performance came to a close, and M. Delaroche,
having taken upon himself to arrange Madame de Marignan's cloak,
carry Madame de Marignan's fan, and put Madame de Marignan's
opera-glass into its morocco case, completed his officiousness by
offering his arm and conducting her into the lobby, whilst I,
outwardly indifferent but inwardly boiling, dropped behind, and
consigned him silently to all the torments of the seven
circles.</p>
<p>It was an oppressive autumnal night without a star in the sky,
and so still that one might have carried a lighted taper through
the streets. Finding it thus warm, Madame de Marignan proposed
walking down the line of carriages, instead of waiting till her own
came up; and so she and M. Delaroche led the way and I followed.
Having found the carriage, he assisted her in, placed her fan and
bouquet on the opposite seat, lingered a moment at the open door,
and had the unparalleled audacity to raise her hand to his lips at
parting. As for me, I stood proudly back, and lifted my hat.</p>
<p>"<i>Comment</i>!" she said, holding out her hand--the pretty,
ungloved hand that had just been kissed--"is that your good
night?"</p>
<p>I bowed over the hand, I would not have touched it with my lips
at that moment for all the wealth of Paris.</p>
<p>"You are coming to me to-morrow morning at twelve?" she murmured
tenderly.</p>
<p>"If Madame desires it."</p>
<p>"Of course I desire it. I am going to Auteuil, to look at a
house for a friend--and to Pignot's for some flowers--and to
Lubin's for some scent--and to a host of places. What should I do
without you? Nay, why that grave face? Have I done anything to
offend you?"</p>
<p>"Madame, I--I confess that--"</p>
<p>"That you are jealous of that absurd Delaroche, who is so much
in love with himself that he has no place in his heart for any one
else! <i>Fi donc!</i> I am ashamed of you. There--adieu, twelve
to-morrow!"</p>
<p>And with this she laughed, waved her hand, gave the signal to
drive on, and left me looking after the carriage, still irritated
but already half consoled.</p>
<p>I then sauntered moodily on, thinking of my tyrant, and her
caprices, and her beauty. Her smile, for instance; surely it was
the sweetest smile in the world--if only she were less lavish of
it! Then, what a delicious little hand--if mine were the only lips
permitted to kiss it! Why was she so charming?--or why, being so
charming, need she prize the attentions of every <i>flaneur</i> who
had only enough wit to admire her? Was I not a fool to believe that
she cared more for my devotion than for another's! Did I believe
it? Yes ... no ... sometimes. But then that "sometimes" was only
when under the immediate influence of her presence. She fascinated
me; but she would fascinate a hundred others in precisely the same
way. It was true that she accepted from me more devotion, more
worship, more time, more outward and visible homage than from any
other. Was I not her <i>Cavaliere servente?</i> Did she not accept
my bouquets? Did she not say the other day, when I gave her that
volume of Tennyson, that she loved all that was English for my
sake? Surely, I was worse than ungrateful, when, having so much, I
was still dissatisfied! Why was I not the happiest fellow in Paris?
Why .....</p>
<p>My meditations were here interrupted by a sudden flash of very
vivid lightning, followed by a low muttering of distant thunder. I
paused, and looked round. The sky was darker than ever, and though
the air was singularly stagnant, I could hear among the uppermost
leaves of the tall trees that stealthy rustling that generally
precedes a storm. Unfortunately for myself, I had not felt disposed
to go home at once on leaving the theatre; but, being restless
alike in mind and body, had struck down through the Place
Vend&ocirc;me and up the Rue de Rivoli, intending to come home by a
circuitous route. At this precise moment I found myself in the
middle of the Place de la Concorde, with Cleopatra's needle
towering above my head, the lamps in the Champs Elys&eacute;es
twinkling in long chains of light through the blank darkness before
me, and no vehicle anywhere in sight. To be caught in a heavy
shower, was not, certainly, an agreeable prospect for one who had
just emerged from the opera in the thinnest of boots and the
lightest of folding hats, with neither umbrella nor palet&ocirc;t
of proof; so, having given a hasty glance in every direction from
which a cab might be expected, I took valiantly to my heels, and
made straight for the Madeleine.</p>
<p>Long before I had accomplished half the distance, however,
another flash announced the quick coming of the tempest, and the
first premonitory drops began to plash down heavily upon the
pavement. Still I ran on, thinking that I should find a cab in the
Place de la Madeleine; but the Place de la Madeleine was empty.
Even the caf&eacute; at the corner was closed. Even the omnibus
office was shut up, and the red lamp above the door
extinguished.</p>
<p>What was I to do now? Panting and breathless, I leaned up
against a doorway, and resigned myself to fate. Stay, what was that
file of carriages, dimly seen through the rain which was now coming
down in earnest? It was in a private street opening off at the back
of the Madeleine--a street in which I could remember no public
stand. Perhaps there was an evening party at one of the large
houses lower down, and, if so, I might surely find a not wholly
incorruptible cabman, who would consent for a liberal
<i>pourboire</i> to drive me home and keep his fare waiting, if
need were, for one little half-hour! At all events it was worth
trying for; so away I darted again, with the wind whistling about
my ears, and the rain driving in my face.</p>
<p>But my troubles were not to be so speedily ended. Among the ten
or fifteen equipages which I found drawn up in file, there was not
one hackney vehicle. They were private carriages, and all,
therefore, inaccessible.</p>
<p>Did I say inaccessible?</p>
<p>A bold idea occurred to me. The rain was so heavy that it could
scarcely be expected to last many minutes. The carriage at the very
end of the line was not likely to be the first called; and, even if
it were, one could spring out in a moment, if necessary. In short,
the very daring of the deed was as attractive as the shelter! I
made my way swiftly down the line. The last carriage was a neat
little brougham, and the coachman, with his hat pulled down over
his eyes, and his collar drawn up about his ears, was too much
absorbed in taking care of himself and his horses to pay much
attention to a foot-passenger. I passed boldly by--doubled back
stealthily on my own steps--looked round cautiously--opened the
door, and glided in.</p>
<p>It was a delightfully comfortable little vehicle--cushioned,
soft, yielding, and pervaded by a delicate perfume of eglantine.
Wondering who the owner might be--if she was young--if she was
pretty--if she was married, or single, or a widow--I settled myself
in the darkest corner of the carriage, intending only to remain
there till the rain had abated. Thus I fell, as fate would have
it--first into a profound reverie, and then into a still profounder
sleep. How long this sleep may have lasted I know not. I only
remember becoming slowly conscious of a gentle movement, which,
without awaking, partly roused me; of a check to that movement,
which brought my thoughts suddenly to the surface; of a stream of
light--of an open door--a crowded hall--a lady waiting to come out,
and a little crowd of attentive beaux surrounding her!</p>
<p>I comprehended my position in an instant, and the impossibility
of extricating myself from it. To get out next the house was to
brave detection; whilst at the other side I found myself blocked in
by carriages. Escape was now hopeless! I turned hot and cold; I
shrank back; I would have gone through the bottom of the carriage,
if I could. At this moment, to my horror, the footman opened the
door. I gave myself up for lost, and, in a sudden access of
desperation, was on the point of rushing out <i>co&ucirc;te que
co&ucirc;te</i>, when the lady ran forward; sprang lightly in;
recoiled; and uttered a little breathless cry of surprise and
apprehension!</p>
<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>, Madame! what is it? Are you hurt?" cried two
or three of the gentlemen, running out, bareheaded, to her
assistance.</p>
<p>But, to my amazement, she unfastened her cloak, and threw it
over me in such a manner as to leave me completely hidden beneath
the folds.</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing, thank you!--I only caught my foot in my cloak. I
am really quite ashamed to have alarmed you! A thousand
thanks--good-night."</p>
<p>And so, with something of a slight tremor in her voice, the lady
drew up the window. The next instant the carriage moved on.</p>
<p>And now, what was to be done? I blessed the accident which
rendered me invisible; but, at the same time, asked myself how it
was to end.</p>
<p>Should I wait till she reached her own door, and then, still
feigning sleep, allow myself to be discovered? Or should I take the
bull by the horns, and reveal myself? If the latter, would she
scream, or faint, or go into hysterics? Then, again, supposing she
resumed her cloak ... a cold damp broke out upon my forehead at the
mere thought! All at once, just as these questions flashed across
my mind, the lady drew the mantle aside, and said:--</p>
<p>"How imprudent of you to hide in my carriage?"</p>
<p>I could not believe my ears.</p>
<p>"Suppose any of those people had caught sight of you ... why, it
would have been all over Paris to-morrow! Happily, I had the
presence of mind to cover you with my cloak; otherwise ... but
there, Monsieur, I have a great mind to be very angry with
you!"</p>
<p>It was now clear that I was mistaken for some one else.
Fortunately the carriage-lamps were unlit, the windows still
blurred with rain, and the night intensely dark; so, feeling like a
wretch reprieved on the scaffold, I shrank farther and farther into
the corner, glad to favor a mistake which promised some hope of
escape.</p>
<p>"<i>Eh bien</i>!" said the lady, half tenderly, half
reproachfully; "have you nothing to say to me?"</p>
<p>Say to her, indeed! What could I say to her? Would not my voice
betray me directly?</p>
<p>"Ah," she continued, without waiting for a reply; "you are
ashamed of the cruel scene of this morning! Well, since you have
not allowed the night to pass without seeking a reconciliation, I
suppose I must forgive you!"</p>
<p>I thought, at this point, that I could not do better than press
her hand, which was exquisitely soft and small--softer and smaller
than even Madame de Marignan's.</p>
<p>"Naughty Hippolyte!" murmured my companion. "Confess, now, that
you were unreasonable."</p>
<p>I sighed heavily, and caressed the little hand with both of
mine.</p>
<p>"And are you very penitent?"</p>
<p>I expressed my penitence by another prodigious sigh, and
ventured, this time, to kiss the tips of the dainty fingers.</p>
<p>"<i>Ciel</i>!" exclaimed the lady. "You have shaved off your
beard! What can have induced you to do such a thing?"</p>
<p>My beard, indeed! Alas! I would have given any money for even a
moustache! However, the fatal moment was come when I must
speak.</p>
<p>"<i>Mon cher ange</i>," I began, trying a hoarse whisper,
"I--I--the fact is--a bet--"</p>
<p>"A bet indeed! The idea of sacrificing such a handsome beard for
a mere bet! I never heard of anything so foolish. But how hoarse
you are, Hippolyte!"</p>
<p>"All within the last hour," whispered I. "I was caught in the
storm, just now, and ..."</p>
<p>"And have taken cold, for my sake! Alas! my poor, dear friend,
why did you wait to speak to me? Why did you not go home at once,
and change your clothes? Your sleeve, I declare, is still quite
damp! Hippolyte, if you fall ill, I shall never forgive
myself!"</p>
<p>I kissed her hand again. It was much pleasanter than whispering,
and expressed all that was necessary.</p>
<p>"But you have not once asked after poor Bibi!" exclaimed my
companion, after a momentary silence. "Poor, dear Bibi, who has
been suffering from a martyrdom with her cough all the
afternoon!"</p>
<p>Now, who the deuce was Bibi? She might be a baby. Or--who could
tell?--she might be a poodle? On this point, however, I was left
uninformed; for my unknown friend, who, luckily, seemed fond of
talking and had a great deal to say, launched off into another
topic immediately.</p>
<p>"After all," said she, "I should have been wrong not to go to
the party! My uncle was evidently pleased with my compliance; and
it is not wise to vex one's rich uncles, if one can help it--is it,
Hippolyte!"</p>
<p>I pressed her hand again.</p>
<p>"Besides, Monsieur Delaroche was not there. He was not even
invited; so you see how far they were from laying matchmaking
plots, and how groundless were all your fears and reproaches!"</p>
<p>Monsieur Delaroche! Could this be the Delaroche of my special
aversion? I pressed her hand again, more closely, more tenderly,
and listened for what might come next.</p>
<p>"Well, it is all over now! And will you promise <i>never, never,
never</i> to be jealous again? Then, to be jealous of such a
creature as that ridiculous Delaroche--a man who knows nothing--who
can think and talk only of his own absurd self!--a man who has not
even wit enough to see that every one laughs at him!"</p>
<p>I was delighted. I longed to embrace her on the spot! Was there
ever such a charming, sensible, lively creature?</p>
<p>"Besides, the coxcomb is just now devoting himself, body and
soul (such as they are!) to that insufferable little
<i>intriguante</i>, Madame de Marignan. He is to be seen with her
in every drawing-room and theatre throughout Paris. For my part, I
am amazed that a woman of the world should suffer herself to be
compromised to that extent--especially one so experienced in these
<i>affaires du coeur</i>."</p>
<p>Madame de Marignan!
Compromised--experienced--<i>intriguante</i>! I felt as if I were
choking.</p>
<p>"To be sure, there is that poor English lad whom she drags about
with her, to play propriety," continued she; "but do you suppose
the world is blinded by so shallow an artifice?"</p>
<p>"What English lad?" I asked, startled out of all sense of
precaution, and desperately resolved to know the worst.</p>
<p>"What English lad? Why, Hippolyte, you are more stupid than
ever! I pointed him out to you the other night at the Comedie
Fran&ccedil;aise--a pale, handsome boy, of about nineteen or
twenty, with brown curling hair, and very fine eyes, which were
riveted on Madame de Marignan the whole evening. Poor fellow! I
cannot help pitying him."</p>
<p>"Then--then, you think she really does not love him?" I said.
And this time my voice was hoarse enough, without any need of
feigning.</p>
<p>"Love him! Ridiculous! What does such a woman understand by
love? Certainly neither the sentiment nor the poetry of it! Tush,
Hippolyte! I do not wish to be censorious; but every one knows that
ever since M. de Marignan has been away in Algiers, that woman has
had, not one devoted admirer, but a dozen; and now that her husband
is coming back...."</p>
<p>"Coming back! ... her husband!" I echoed, half rising in my
place, and falling back again, as if stunned. "Good heavens! is she
not a widow?"</p>
<p>It was now the lady's turn to be startled.</p>
<p>"A widow!" she repeated. "Why, you know as well as I
that--<i>Dieu</i>! To whom I am speaking?"</p>
<p>"Madame," I said, as steadily as my agitation would let me, "I
beg you not to be alarmed. I am not, it is true, the person whom
you have supposed; but--Nay, I implore you...."</p>
<p>She here uttered a quick cry, and darted forward for the
check-string. Arresting her hand half way, respectfully but firmly,
I went on:--</p>
<p>"How I came here, I will explain presently. I am a gentleman;
and upon the word of a gentleman, Madame, am innocent of any desire
to offend or alarm you. Can you--will you--hear me for one
moment?"</p>
<p>"I appear, sir, to have no alternative," replied she, trembling
like a caged bird.</p>
<p>"I might have left you undeceived, Madame. I might have
extricated myself from, this painful position undiscovered--but for
some words which just escaped your lips; some words so nearly
concerning the--the honor and happiness of--of.... in short, I lost
my presence of mind. I now implore you to tell me if all that you
have just been saying of Madame de Marignan is strictly true."</p>
<p>"Who are you, sir, that you should dare to surprise confidences
intended for another, and by what right do you question me?" said
the lady, haughtily.</p>
<p>"By no right, Madame," I replied, fairly breaking into sobs, and
burying my face in my hands. "I can only appeal to your compassion.
I am that Englishman whom--whom...."</p>
<p>For a moment there was silence. My companion was the first to
speak.</p>
<p>"Poor boy!" she said; and her voice, now, was gentle and
compassionate. "You have been rudely undeceived. Did Madame de
Marignan pass herself off upon you for a widow?"</p>
<p>"She never named her husband to me--I believed that she was
free. I fancied he had been dead for years. She knew that was my
impression."</p>
<p>"And you would have married her--actually married her?"</p>
<p>"I--I--hardly dared to hope...."</p>
<p>"<i>Ciel</i>! it is almost beyond belief. And you never inquired
into her past history?"</p>
<p>"Never. Why should I?"</p>
<p>"Monsieur de Marignan holds a government appointment in Algiers,
and has been absent more than four years. He is, I understand,
expected back shortly, on leave of absence."</p>
<p>I conquered my agitation by a supreme effort.</p>
<p>"Madame," I said, "I thank you. It now only remains for me to
explain my intrusion. I can do so in half a dozen words. Caught in
the storm and unable to find a conveyance, I sought shelter in this
carriage, which being the last on the file, offered the only refuge
of which I could avail myself unobserved. While waiting for the
tempest to abate, I fell asleep; and but for the chance which led
you to mistake me for another, I must have been discovered when you
entered the carriage."</p>
<p>"Then, finding yourself so mistaken, Monsieur, would it not have
been more honorable to undeceive me than to usurp a conversation
which...."</p>
<p>"Madame, I dared not. I feared to alarm you--I hoped to find
some means of escape, and...."</p>
<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>! what means? How are you to escape as it is?
How leave the carriage without being seen by my servants?"</p>
<p>I had not thought of this, nor of the dilemma in which my
presence must place her.</p>
<p>"I can open the door softly," said I, "and jump out
unperceived."</p>
<p>"Impossible, at the pace we are going! You would break your
neck."</p>
<p>I shook my head, and laughed bitterly.</p>
<p>"Have no fear of that, Madame," I said. "Those who least value
their necks never happen to break them. See, I can spring out as we
pass the next turning, and be out of sight in a moment."</p>
<p>"Indeed, I will not permit it. Oh, dear! we have already reached
the Faubourg St. Germain. Stay--I have an idea I Do you know what
o'clock it is?"</p>
<p>"I don't know how long I may have slept; but I think it must be
quite three."</p>
<p>"<i>Bien</i>! The Countess de Blois has a ball to-night, and her
visitors are sure not to disperse before four or five. My sister is
there. I will send in to ask if she has yet gone home, and when the
carriage stops you can slip out. Here is the Rue de Bac, and the
door of her hotel is yet surrounded with equipages."</p>
<p>And with this, she let down a front window, desired the coachman
to stop, leaned forward so as to hide me completely, and sent in
her footman with the message. When the man had fairly entered the
hall, she turned to me and said:--</p>
<p>"Now, Monsieur, fly! It is your only chance."</p>
<p>"I go, Madame; but before going, suffer me to assure you that I
know neither your name, nor that of the person for whom you mistook
me--that I have no idea of your place of residence--that I should
not know you if I saw you again to-morrow--in short, that you are
to me as entirely a stranger as if this adventure had never
happened."</p>
<p>"Monsieur, I thank you for the assurance; but I see the servant
returning. Pray, begone!"</p>
<p>I sprang out without another word, and, never once looking back,
darted down a neighboring street and waited in the shadow of a
doorway till I thought the carriage must be out of sight.</p>
<p>The night was now fine, the moon was up, and the sky was full of
stars. But I heeded nothing, save my own perplexed and painful
thoughts. Absorbed in these, I followed the course of the Rue du
Bac till I came to the Pont National. There my steps were arrested
by the sight of the eddying river, the long gleaming front of the
Louvre, the quaint, glistening gables of the Tuilleries, the
far-reaching trees of the Champs Elys&eacute;es all silvered in the
soft, uncertain moonlight. It was a most calm and beautiful
picture; and I stood for a long time leaning against the parapet of
the bridge, and looking dreamily at the scene before me. Then I
heard the quarters chime from belfry to belfry all over the quiet
city, and found that it was half-past three o'clock. Presently a
patrol of <i>gendarmes</i> went by, and, finding that they paused
and looked at me suspiciously, I turned away, and bent my steps
homewards.</p>
<p>By the time I reached the Cit&eacute; Berg&egrave;re it was past
four, and the early market-carts were already rumbling along the
Rue du Faubourg Montmartre. Going up wearily to my apartments, I
found a note waiting for me in Dalrymple's handwriting. It ran
thus:--</p>
<p>"MY DEAR DAMON:--</p>
<p>"Do you know that it is nearly a month since I last saw you? Do
you know that I have called twice at your lodgings without finding
you at home? I hear of you as having been constantly seen, of late,
in the society of a very pretty woman of our acquaintance; but I
confess that I do not desire to see you go to the devil entirely
without the friendly assistance of</p>
<p>"Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>"OSCAR DALRYMPLE."</p>
<p>I read the note twice. I could scarcely believe that I had so
neglected my only friend. Had I been mad? Or a fool?--or both? Too
anxious and unhappy to sleep, and too tired to sit up, I lit my
lamp, threw myself upon the bed, and there lay repenting my wasted
hours, my misplaced love and my egregious folly, till morning came
with its sunshine and its traffic, and found me a "wiser," if not a
"better man."</p>
<p>"Half-past seven!" exclaimed I to myself, as I jumped up and
plunged my head into a basin of cold water. "Dr. Ch&eacute;ron
shall see me before nine this morning. I'll call on Dalrymple at
luncheon time; at three, I must get back for the afternoon lecture;
and in the evening--in the evening, by Jove! Madame de Marignan
must be content with her adorable Delaroche, for the deuce a bit of
her humble servant will she ever see again!"</p>
<p>And away I went presently along the sunny streets, humming to
myself those saucy and wholesome lines of good Sir Walter
Raleigh's:--</p>
<blockquote>"Shall I like a hermit dwell<br>
On a rock, or in a cell,<br>
Calling home the smallest part<br>
That is missing of my heart,<br>
To bestow it where I may<br>
Meet a rival every day?<br>
If she undervalues me,<br>
What care I how fair she be?"</blockquote>

<h3>THE WIDOW OF A MINISTER OF FINANCE.</h3>
<br>
<p>"You are just in time, Arbuthnot, to do me a service," said
Dalrymple, looking up from his desk as I went in, and reaching out
his hand to me over a barricade of books and papers.</p>
<p>"Then I am very glad I have come," I replied. "But what
confusion is this? Are you going anywhere?"</p>
<p>"Yes--to perdition. There, kick that rubbish out of your way and
sit down."</p>
<p>Never very orderly, Dalrymple's rooms were this time in as
terrible a litter as can well be conceived. The table was piled
high with bills, old letters, books, cigars, gloves, card-cases,
and pamphlets. The carpet was strewn with portmanteaus, hat-cases,
travelling-straps, old luggage labels, railway wrappers, and the
like. The chairs and sofas were laden with wearing apparel. As for
Dalrymple himself, he looked haggard and weary, as though the last
four weeks had laid four years upon his shoulders.</p>
<p>"You look ill," I said clearing a corner of the sofa for my own
accommodation; "or <i>ennuy&eacute;</i>, which is much the same
thing. What is the matter? And what can I do for you?"</p>
<p>"The matter is that I am going abroad," said he, with his chin
resting moodily in his two palms and his elbows on the table.</p>
<p>"Going abroad! Where?"</p>
<p>"I don't know--</p>
<blockquote>'Anywhere, anywhere, out of the world.'</blockquote>
<p>It's of very little consequence whether I betake myself to the
East or to the West; eat rice in the tropics, or drink train-oil at
the Pole."</p>
<p>"But have you no settled projects?"</p>
<p>"None whatever."</p>
<p>"And don't care what becomes of you?"</p>
<p>"Not in the least."</p>
<p>"Then, in Heaven's name, what has happened?"</p>
<p>"The very thing that, three weeks ago, would have made me the
happiest fellow in Christendom. What are you going to do
to-morrow?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, beyond my ordinary routine of medical study."</p>
<p>"Humph! Could you get a whole holiday, for once?"</p>
<p>I remembered how many I had taken of late, and felt ashamed of
the readiness with which I replied:--</p>
<p>"Oh yes! easily."</p>
<p>"Well, then, I want you to spend the day with me. It will be,
perhaps, my last in Paris for many a month, or even many a year. I
... Pshaw! I may as well say it, and have done with it. I am going
to be married."</p>
<p>"Married!" I exclaimed, in blank amazement; for it was the last
thing I should have guessed.</p>
<p>Dalrymple tugged away at his moustache with both hands, as was
his habit when perplexed or troubled, and nodded gloomily. "To
whom?"</p>
<p>"To Madame de Courcelles."</p>
<p>"And are you not very happy?"</p>
<p>"Happy! I am the most miserable dog unhanged?"</p>
<p>I was more at fault now than ever.</p>
<p>"I ... judging from trifles which some would perhaps scarcely
have observed," I said, hesitatingly, "I--I thought you were
interested in Madame de Courcelles?"</p>
<p>"Interested!" cried he, pushing back his chair and springing to
his feet, as if the word had stung him. "By heaven! I love that
woman as I never loved in my life."</p>
<p>"Then why ..."</p>
<p>"I'll tell you why--or, at least, I will tell you as much as I
may--as I can; for the affair is hers, and not mine. She has a
cousin--curse him!--to whom she was betrothed from childhood. His
estates adjoined hers; family interests were concerned in their
union; and the parents on both sides arranged matters. When,
however, Monsieur de Courcelles fell in love with her--a man much
older than herself, but possessed of great wealth and immense
political influence--her father did not hesitate to send the cousin
to the deuce and marry his daughter to the Minister of Finance. The
cousin, it seems, was then a wild young fellow; not particularly in
love with her himself; and not at all inconsolable for her loss.
When, however, Monsieur de Courcelles was good enough to die (which
he had the bad taste to do very hastily, and without making, by any
means, the splendid provision for his widow which he had promised),
our friend, the cousin, comes forward again. By this time he is
enough man of the world to appreciate the value of land--more
especially as he has sold, mortgaged, played the mischief with
nearly every acre of his own. He pleads the old engagement, and, as
he is pleased to call it, the old love. Madame de Courcelles is a
young widow, very solitary, with no one to love, no object to live
for, and no experience of the world. Her pity is easily awaked; and
the result is that she not only accepts the cousin, but lends him
large sums of money; suffers the title-deeds of her estates to go
into the hands of his lawyer; and is formally betrothed to him
before the eyes of all Paris!"</p>
<p>"Who is this man? Where is he?" I asked, eagerly.</p>
<p>"He is an officer of Chasseurs, now serving with his regiment in
Algiers--a daring, dashing, reckless fellow; heartless and
dissipated enough; but a splendid soldier. However, having
committed her property to his hands, and suffered her name to be
associated publicly with his, Madame de Courcelles, during his
absence in Algiers, has done me the honor to prefer me. I have the
first real love of her life, and the short and long of it is, that
we are to be privately married to-morrow."</p>
<p>"And why privately?"</p>
<p>"Ah, there's the pity of it! There's the disappointment and the
bitterness!"</p>
<p>"Can't Madame de Courcelles write and tell this man that she
loves somebody else better?"</p>
<p>"Confound it! no. The fellow has her too much in his power, and,
if he chose to be dishonest, could half ruin her. At all events she
is afraid of him; and I ... I am as helpless as a child in the
matter. If I were a rich man, I would snap my fingers at him; but
how can I, with a paltry eight hundred a year, provide for that
woman? Pshaw! If I could but settle it with a pair of hair-triggers
and twenty paces of turf, I'd leave little work for the
lawyers!"</p>
<p>"Well, then, what is to be done?"</p>
<p>"Only this," replied he, striding impatiently to and fro, like a
caged lion; "I must just bear with my helplessness, and leave the
remedy to those who can oppose skill to skill, and lawyer to
lawyer."</p>
<p>"At all events, you marry the lady."</p>
<p>"Ay--I marry the lady; but I start to-morrow night for Berlin,
<i>en route</i> for anywhere that chance may lead me."</p>
<p>"Without her?"</p>
<p>"Without her. Do you suppose that I would stay in Paris--her
husband--and live apart from her? Meet her, like an ordinary
acquaintance? See others admiring her? Be content to lounge in and
out of her <i>soir&eacute;es</i>, or ride beside her carriage now
and then, as you or fifty others might do? Perhaps, have even to
endure the presence of De Caylus himself? <i>Merci</i>! Any number
of miles, whether of land or sea, were better than a martyrdom like
that!"</p>
<p>"De Caylus!" I repeated. "Where have I heard that name?"</p>
<p>"You may have heard of it in a hundred places," replied my
friend. "As I said before, the man is a gallant soldier, and does
gallant things. But to return to the present question--may I depend
on you to-morrow? For we must have a witness, and our witness must
be both discreet and silent."</p>
<p>"On my silence and discretion you may rely absolutely."</p>
<p>"And you can be here by nine?"</p>
<p>"By daybreak, if you please."</p>
<p>"I won't tax you to that extent. Nine will do quite well."</p>
<p>"Adieu, then, till nine."</p>
<p>"Adieu, and thank you."</p>
<p>With this I left him, somewhat relieved to find that I had
escaped all cross-examination on the score of Madame Marignan.</p>
<p>"De Caylus!" I again repeated to myself, as I took my rapid way
to the Hotel Dieu. "De Caylus! why, surely, it must have been that
evening at Madame de Courcelles'...."</p>
<p>And then I recollected that De Caylus was the name of that
officer who was said to have ridden by night, and single-handed,
through the heart of the enemy's camp, somewhere in Algiers.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII."></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<h3>A MARRIAGE NOT "A LA MODE."</h3>
<br>
<p>The marriage took place in a little out-of-the-way Protestant
chapel beyond the barriers, at about a quarter before ten o'clock
the next morning. Dalrymple and I were there first; and Madame de
Courcelles, having, in order to avoid observation, come part of the
distance in a cab and part on foot, arrived a few minutes later.
She was very pale, and looked almost like a <i>religieuse</i>, with
her black veil tied closely under her chin, and a dark violet
dress, which might have passed for mourning. She gave her hand to
Dalrymple without speaking; then knelt down at the communion-table,
and so remained till we had all taken our places. As for Dalrymple,
he had even less color than she, but held his head up haughtily,
and betrayed no sign of the conflict within.</p>
<p>It was a melancholy little chapel, dusty and neglected, full of
black and white funereal tablets, and damp as a vault. We shivered
as we stood about the altar; the clergyman's teeth chattered as he
began the marriage service; and the echoes of our responses
reverberated forlornly up among the gothic rafters overhead. Even
the sunbeams struggled sadly and palely down the upper windows, and
the chill wind whistled in when the door was opened, bringing with
it a moan of coming rain.</p>
<p>The ceremony over, the books signed in the vestry, and the
clergyman, clerk, and pew-opener duly remunerated for their
services, we prepared to be gone. For a couple of moments,
Dalrymple and his bride stood apart in the shadow of the porch. I
saw him take the hand on which he had just placed the ring, and
look down upon it tenderly, wistfully--I saw him bend lower, and
lower, whispering what no other ears might hear--saw their lips
meet for one brief instant. Then the lady's veil was lowered; she
turned hastily away; and Dalrymple was left standing in the doorway
alone.</p>
<p>"By Heaven!" said he, grasping my hand as though he would crush
it. "This is hard to bear."</p>
<p>I but returned the pressure of his hand; for I knew not with
what words to comfort him. Thus we lingered for some minutes in
silence, till the clergyman, having put off his surplice, passed us
with a bow and went out; and the pew-opener, after pretending to
polish the door-handle with her apron, and otherwise waiting about
with an air of fidgety politeness, dropped a civil curtsey, and
begged to remind us that the chapel must now be closed.</p>
<p>Dalrymple started and shook himself like a water-dog, as if he
would so shake off "the slings and arrows of outrageous
fortune."</p>
<p>"<i>Rex est qui metuit nihil</i>!" said he; "but I am a
sovereign in bad circumstances, for all that. Heigho! Care will
kill a cat. What shall we do with ourselves, old fellow, for the
rest of the day?"</p>
<p>"I hardly know. Would you like to go into the country?"</p>
<p>"Nothing better. The air perhaps would exorcise some of these
blue-devils."</p>
<p>"What say you to St. Germains? It looks as if it must rain
before night; yet there is the forest and...."</p>
<p>"Excellent! We can do as we like, with nobody to stare at us;
and I am in a horribly uncivilized frame of mind this morning."</p>
<p>With this, we turned once more toward Paris, and, jumping into
the first cab that came by, were driven to the station. It happened
that a train was then about to start; so we were off
immediately.</p>
<p>There were no other passengers in the carriage, so Dalrymple
infringed the company's mandate by lighting a cigar, and I, finding
him disinclined for talk, did the same thing, and watched the
passing country. Flat and uninteresting at first, it consisted of a
mere sandy plain, treeless, hedgeless, and imperfectly cultivated
with struggling strips of corn and vegetables. By and by came a
line of stunted pollards, a hamlet, and a little dreary cemetery.
Then the landscape improved. The straight line of the horizon broke
into gentle undulations; the Seine, studded with islets, wound
through the meadow-land at our feet; and a lofty viaduct carried us
from height to height across the eddying river. Then we passed into
the close green shade of a forest, which opened every here and
there into long vistas, yielding glimpses of</p>
<blockquote>"--verdurous glooms, and winding mossy
ways."</blockquote>
<p>Through this wood the line continued to run till we reached our
destination. Here our first few steps brought us out upon the
Place, directly facing the old red and black chateau of St.
Germain-en-Laye. Leaving this and the little dull town behind us,
we loitered for some time about the broad walks of the park, and
then passed on into the forest. Although it was neither Sunday nor
a f&ecirc;te-day, there were pleasure parties gipseying under
trees--Parisian cockneys riding raw-boned steeds--pony-chaises full
of laughing grisettes dashing up and down the broad roads that
pierce the wood in various directions--old women selling cakes and
lemonade--workmen gambling with half-pence on the smooth turf by
the wayside--<i>bonnes</i>, comely and important, with their little
charges playing round them, and their busy fingers plying the
knitting-needles as they walked--young ladies sketching trees, and
prudent governesses reading novels close by; in short, all the life
and variety of a favorite suburban resort on an ordinarily fine day
about the beginning of autumn.</p>
<p>Leaving the frequented routes to the right, we turned into one
of the many hundred tracks that diverge in every direction from the
beaten roads, and wandered deeper and deeper into the green shades
and solitudes of the forest. Pausing, presently, to rest, Dalrymple
threw himself at full length on the mossy ground, with his hands
clasping the back of his head, and his hat over his eyes; whilst I
found a luxurious arm-chair in the gnarled roots of a lichen-tufted
elm. Thus we remained for a considerable time puffing away at our
cigars in that sociable silence which may almost claim to be an
unique privilege of masculine friendship. Women cannot sit together
for long without talking; men can enjoy each other's companionship
for hours with scarcely the interchange of an idea.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I watched the squirrels up in the beech-trees and the
dancing of the green leaves against the sky; and thought dreamily
of home, of my father, of the far past, and the possible future. I
asked myself how, when my term of study came to an end, I should
ever again endure the old home-life at Saxonholme? How settle down
for life as my father's partner, conforming myself to his
prejudices, obeying all the demands of his imperious temper, and
accepting for evermore the monotonous routine of a provincial
practice! It was an intolerable prospect, but no less inevitable
than intolerable. Pondering thus, I sighed heavily, and the sigh
roused Dalrymple's attention.</p>
<p>"Why, Damon," said he, turning over on his elbow, and pushing up
his hat to the level of his eyes, "what's the matter with you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing--at least, nothing new."</p>
<p>"Well, new or old, what is it? A man must be either in debt, or
in love, when he sighs in that way. You look as melancholy as
Werter redivivus!"</p>
<p>"I--I ought not to be melancholy, I suppose; for I was thinking
of home."</p>
<p>Dalrymple's face and voice softened immediately.</p>
<p>"Poor boy!" he said, throwing away the end of his cigar, "yours
is not a bright home, I fear. You told me, I think, that you had
lost your mother?"</p>
<p>"From infancy."</p>
<p>"And you have no sisters?"</p>
<p>"None. I am an only child."</p>
<p>"Your father, however, is living?"</p>
<p>"Yes, my father lives. He is a rough-tempered, eccentric man;
misanthropic, but clever; kind enough, and generous enough, in his
own strange way. Still--"</p>
<p>"Still what?"</p>
<p>--"I dread the life that lies before me! I dread the life
without society, without ambition, without change--the dull
house--the bounded sphere of action--the bondage.... But of what
use is it to trouble you with these things?"</p>
<p>"This use, that it does you good to tell, and me to listen.
Sympathy, like mercy, blesseth him that gives and him that takes;
and if I cannot actually help you, I am, at all events, thankful to
be taken out of myself. Go on--tell me more of your prospects. Have
you no acquaintance at Saxonholme whose society will make the place
pleasant to you? No boyish friends? No pretty cousins? No
first-loves, from amongst whom to choose a wife in time to
come?"</p>
<p>I shook my head sadly.</p>
<p>"Did I not tell you that my father was a misanthrope? He visits
no one, unless professionally. We have no friends and no
relations."</p>
<p>"Humph! that's awkward. However, it leaves you free to choose
your own friends, when you go back. A medical man need never be
without a visiting connection. His very profession puts a thousand
opportunities in his way."</p>
<p>"That is true; but--"</p>
<p>"But what?"</p>
<p>"I am not fond of the profession. I have never liked it. I would
give much to relinquish it altogether."</p>
<p>Dalrymple gave utterance to a prolonged and very dismal
whistle.</p>
<p>"This," said he gravely, "is the most serious part of the
business. To live in a dull place is bad enough--to live with dull
people is bad enough; but to have one's thoughts perpetually
occupied with an uncongenial subject, and one's energies devoted to
an uncongenial pursuit, is just misery, and nothing short of it! In
fact 'tis a moral injustice, and one that no man should be required
to endure."</p>
<p>"Yet I must endure it."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because it is too late to do otherwise."</p>
<p>"It is never too late to repair an evil, or an error."</p>
<p>"Unless the repairing of it involved a worse evil, or a more
fatal error! No--I must not dream now of turning aside from the
path that has been chosen for me. Too much time and too much money
have been given to the thing for that;--I must let it take its
course. There's no help for it!"</p>
<p>"But, confound it, lad! you'd better follow the fife and drum,
or go before the mast, than give up your life to a profession you
hate!"</p>
<p>"Hate is a strong word," I replied. "I do not actually hate
it--at all events I must try to make the best of it, if only for my
father's sake. His heart is set on making a physician of me, and I
dare not disappoint him."</p>
<p>Dalrymple looked at me fixedly, and then fell back into his old
position.</p>
<p>"Heigho!" he said, pulling his hat once more over his eyes, "I
was a disobedient son. My father intended me for the Church; I was
expelled from College for fighting a duel before I was twenty, and
then, sooner than go home disgraced, enlisted as a private soldier
in a cavalry corps bound for foreign service. Luckily, they found
me out before the ship sailed, and made the best of a bad bargain
by purchasing me a cornetcy in a dragoon regiment. I would not
advise you to be disobedient, Damon. My experience in that line has
been bitter enough,"</p>
<p>"How so? You escaped a profession for which you were
disinclined, and entered one for which you had every
qualification."</p>
<p>"Ay; but think of the cursed <i>esclandre</i>--first the duel,
then the expulsion, then my disappearance for two months ... My
mother was in bad health at the time, too; and I, her favorite
son--I--in short, the anxiety was too much for her. She--she died
before I had been six weeks in the regiment. There! we won't talk
of it. It's the one subject that ..."</p>
<p>His voice faltered, and he broke off abruptly.</p>
<p>"I wish you were going with me to Berlin," said he, after a long
silence which I had not attempted to interrupt.</p>
<p>"I wish with all my heart that I were!"</p>
<p>"And yet," he added, "I am glad on--on her account, that you
remain in Paris. You will call upon her sometimes, Arbuthnot?"</p>
<p>"If Madame De Cour.... I mean, if Mrs. Dalrymple will permit
me."</p>
<p>An involuntary smile flitted across his lips--the first I had
seen there all the day.</p>
<p>"She will be glad--grateful. She knows that I value you, and she
has proof that I trust you. You are the only possessor of our
secret."</p>
<p>"It is as safe with me," I said, "as if I were dead, and in my
grave."</p>
<p>"I know it, old fellow. Well--you will see her sometimes. You
will write to me, and tell me how she is looking. If--if she were
to fall ill, you would not conceal it from me? and in case of any
emergency--any annoyance arising from De Caylus ..."</p>
<p>"Were she my own sister," I said, earnestly, "she would not find
me readier to assist or defend her. Of this, Dalrymple, be
assured."</p>
<p>"Thank you," he said, and stretched up his hand to me. "I do
believe you are true--though there are few men, and still fewer
women, of whom I should like to say as much. By the way, Arbuthnot,
beware of that little flirt, Madame de Marignan. She has charming
eyes, but no more heart than a vampire. Besides, an entanglement
with a married woman!... <i>cela ne se peut pas, mon cher</i>. You
are too young to venture on such dangerous ground, and too
inexperienced."</p>
<p>I smiled--perhaps somewhat bitterly--for the wound was still
fresh, and I could not help wincing when any hand came near it.</p>
<p>"You are right," I replied. "Madame de Marignan is a dangerous
woman; but dangerous for me no longer. However, I have paid rather
dearly for my safety."</p>
<p>And with this, I told him the whole story from beginning to end,
confessing all my follies without reservation. Surprised, amused,
sometimes unable to repress a smile, sometimes genuinely
compassionate, he heard my narrative through, accompanying it from
time to time with muttered comments and ejaculations, none of which
were very flattering to Madame de Marignan. When I had done, he
sprang to his feet, laid his hand heavily upon my shoulder, and
said:--</p>
<p>"Damon, there are a great many disagreeable things in life which
wise people say are good for us, and for which they tell us we
ought to be grateful in proportion to our discomfort. For my own
part, however, I am no optimist. I am not fond of mortifying the
flesh, and the eloquence of Socrates would fail to persuade me that
a carbuncle was a cheerful companion, or the gout an ailment to be
ardently desired. Yet, for all this, I cannot say that I look upon
your adventure in the light of a misfortune. You have lost time,
spent money, and endured a considerable amount of aggravation; but
you have, on the other hand, acquired ease of manner, facility of
conversation, and just that necessary polish which fits a man for
society. Come! you have received a valuable lesson both in morals
and manners; so farewell to Madame de Marignan, and let us write
<i>Pour acquit</i> against the score!"</p>
<p>Willing enough to accept this cheerful view, I flourished an
imaginary autograph upon the air with the end of my cane, and
laughingly dismissed the subject.</p>
<p>We then strolled back through the wood, treading the soft moss
under our feet, startling the brown lizards from our path and the
squirrels from the lower branches of the great trees, and, now and
then, surprising a plump little green frog, which went skipping
away into the long grass, like an animated emerald. Coming back to
the gardens, we next lingered for some time upon the terrace,
admiring the superb panorama of undulating woodland and cultivated
champaign, which, seen through the golden haze of afternoon,
stretched out in glory to the remotest horizon. To our right stood
the prison-like chateau, flinging back the sunset from its
innumerable casements, and seeming to drink in the warm glow at
every pore of its old, red bricks. To our left, all lighted up
against the sky, rose the lofty tree-tops of the forest which we
had just quitted. Our shadows stretched behind us across the level
terrace, like the shadows of giants. Involuntarily, we dropped our
voices. It would have seemed almost like profanity to speak aloud
while the first influence of that scene was upon us.</p>
<p>Going on presently towards the verge of the terrace, we came
upon an artist who, with his camp-stool under his arm, and his
portfolio at his feet, was, like ourselves, taking a last look at
the sunset before going away. As we approached, he turned and
recognised us. It was Herr Franz M&uuml;ller, the story-telling
student of the <i>Chicards</i> club.</p>
<p>"Good-afternoon, gentlemen," said he, lifting his red cap, and
letting it fall back again a little on one side. "We do not see
many such sunsets in the course of the summer."</p>
<p>"Indeed, no," replied Dalrymple; "and ere long the autumn tints
will be creeping over the landscape, and the whole scene will
assume a different character. Have you been sketching in the
forest?"</p>
<p>"No--I have been making a study of the chateau and terrace from
this point, with the landscape beyond. It is for an historical
subject which I have laid out for my winter's work."</p>
<p>And with this, he good-naturedly opened his folio and took out
the sketch, which was a tolerably large one, and represented the
scene under much the same conditions of light as we now saw it.</p>
<p>"I shall have a group of figures here," he said, pointing to a
spot on the terrace, "and a more distant one there; with a
sprinkling of dogs and, perhaps, a head or two at an open window of
the chateau. I shall also add a flag flying on the turret,
yonder."</p>
<p>"A scene, I suppose, from the life of Louis the Thirteenth," I
suggested.</p>
<p>"No--I mean it for the exiled court of James the Second,"
replied he. "And I shall bring in the King, and Mary of Modena, and
the Prince their son, who was afterwards the Pretender."</p>
<p>"It is a good subject," said Dalrymple. "You will of course find
excellent portraits of all these people at Versailles; and a lively
description of their court, mode of life, and so forth, if my
memory serves me correctly, in the tales of Anthony, Count
Hamilton. But with all this, I dare say, you are better acquainted
than I."</p>
<p>"<i>Parbleu!</i> not I," said the student, shouldering his
camp-stool as if it were a musket, and slinging his portfolio by a
strap across his back; "therefore, I am all the more obliged to you
for the information. My reading is neither very extensive nor very
useful; and as for my library, I could pack it all into a hat-case
any day, and find room for a few other trifles at the same time.
Here is the author I chiefly study. He is my constant companion,
and, like myself, looks somewhat the worse for wear."</p>
<p>Saying which, he produced from one of his pockets a little,
greasy, dog-eared volume of Beranger, about the size of a small
snuff-box, and began singing aloud, to a very cheerful air, a song
of which a certain faithless Mademoiselle Lisette was the heroine,
and of which the refrain was always:--</p>
<blockquote>"<i>Lisette! ma Lisette,<br>
Tu m'as tromp&eacute; toujours;<br>
Je veux, Lisette,<br>
Boire &agrave; nos amours</i>."</blockquote>
<p>To this accompaniment we walked back through the gardens to the
railway station, where, being a quarter of an hour too soon, our
companion amused himself by "chaffing," questioning, contradicting,
and otherwise ingeniously tormenting the check-takers and porters
of the establishment. One pompous official, in particular, became
so helplessly indignant that he retired into a little office
overlooking the platform, and was heard to swear fluently, all by
himself, for several minutes. The time having expired and the doors
being opened, we passed out with the rest of the home-going
Parisians, and were about to take our places, when M&uuml;ller,
climbing like a cat to the roof-seats on the top of the
second-class carriages, beckoned us to follow.</p>
<p>"Who would be shut up with ten fat people and a baby, when fresh
air can be breathed, and tobacco smoked, for precisely the same
fare?" asked he. "You don't mean to say that you came down to St.
Germains in one of the dens below?"</p>
<p>"Yes, we did," I replied; "but we had it to ourselves."</p>
<p>"So much the worse. Man is a gregarious animal, and woman
also--which proves Zimmerman to have been neither, and accounts for
the brotherhood of <i>Les Chicards</i>. Would you like to see how
that old gentleman looks when he is angry?"</p>
<p>"Which? The one in the opposite corner?"</p>
<p>"The same."</p>
<p>"Well, that depends on circumstances. Why do you ask?"</p>
<p>"Because I'll engage to satisfy your curiosity in less than ten
minutes."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, don't affront him," said I. "We shall only have a
scene."</p>
<p>"I won't affront him. I promise not to utter a syllable, either
offensive or defensive."</p>
<p>"Leave him alone, then, poor devil!"</p>
<p>"Nonsense! If he chooses to be annoyed, that's his business, and
not mine. Now, you'll see."</p>
<p>And M&uuml;ller, alert for mischief, stared fixedly at the old
gentleman in the opposite corner for some minutes--then
sighed--roused himself as if from a profound reverie--seized his
portfolio--took &nbsp;out a pencil and sketch-book--mended the
pencil<br>
with an elaborate show of fastidiousness and deliberation--stared
&nbsp;again--drew a deep breath--turned somewhat aside, as<br>
if anxious to conceal his object, and began sketching rapidly. Now
and then he paused; stole a furtive glance over his shoulder; bit
his lip; rubbed out; corrected; glanced again; and then went on
rapidly as before.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the old gentleman, who was somewhat red and
irascible, began to get seriously uncomfortable. He frowned,
fidgeted, coughed, buttoned and unbuttoned his coat, and jealously
watched every proceeding of his tormentor. A general smile dawned
upon the faces of the rest of the travellers. The priest over the
way pinched his lips together, and looked down demurely. The two
girls, next to the priest, tittered behind their handkerchiefs. The
young man with the blue cravat sucked the top of his cane, and
winked openly at his companions, both of whom were cracking nuts,
and flinging the shells down the embankment. Presently M&uuml;ller
threw his head back, held the drawing off, still studiously keeping
the back of it towards the rest of the passengers; looked at it
with half-closed eyes; stole another exceedingly cautious glance at
his victim; and then, affecting for the first time to find himself
observed, made a vast show of pretending to sketch the country
through which we were passing.</p>
<p>The old gentleman could stand it no longer.</p>
<p>"Monsieur," said he, angrily. "Monsieur, I will thank you not to
take my portrait. I object to it. Monsieur."</p>
<p>"Charming distance," said M&uuml;ller, addressing himself to me
"Wants interest, however, in the foreground. That's a picturesque
tree yonder, is it not?"</p>
<p>The old gentleman struck his umbrella sharply on the floor.</p>
<p>"It's of no use, Monsieur," he exclaimed, getting more red and
excited. "You are taking my portrait, and I object to it. I know
you are taking my portrait."</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller looked up dreamily.</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon, Monsieur," said he. "Did you speak?'</p>
<p>"Yes, Monsieur. I did speak. I repeat that you shall not take my
portrait."</p>
<p>"Your portrait, Monsieur?"</p>
<p>"Yes, my portrait!"</p>
<p>"But, Monsieur," remonstrated the artist, with an air of mingled
candor and surprise, "I never dreamed of taking your portrait!"</p>
<p>"<i>Sacre non</i>!" shouted the old gentleman, with another rap
of the umbrella. "I saw you do it! Everybody saw you do It!"</p>
<p>"Nay, if Monsieur will but do me the honor to believe that I was
simply sketching from nature, as the train...."</p>
<p>"An impudent subterfuge, sir!" interrupted the old gentleman.
"An impudent subterfuge, and nothing less!"</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller drew himself up with immense dignity.</p>
<p>"Monsieur," he said, haughtily, "that is an expression which I
must request you to retract. I have already assured you, on the
word of a gentleman...."</p>
<p>"A gentleman, indeed! A pretty gentleman! He takes my portrait,
and...."</p>
<p>"I have not taken your portrait, Monsieur."</p>
<p>"Good heavens!" cried the old gentleman, looking round, "was
ever such assurance! Did not every one present see him in the act?
I appeal to every one--to you, Monsieur--to you, Mesdames,--to you,
reverend father,--did you not all see this person taking my
portrait?"</p>
<p>"Nay, then, if it must come to this," said M&uuml;ller, "let the
sketch be evidence, and let these ladies and gentlemen decide
whether it is really the portrait of Monsieur--and if they think it
like?"</p>
<p>Saying which, he held up the book, and displayed a head,
sketched, it is true, with admirable spirit and cleverness,
but--the head of an ass, with a thistle in its mouth!</p>
<p>A simultaneous explosion of mirth followed. Even the priest
laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks, and Dalrymple,
heavy-hearted as he was, could not help joining in the general
shout. As for the old gentleman, the victim of this elaborate
practical joke, he glared at us all round, swore that it was a
premeditated insult from beginning to end, and, swelling with
suppressed rage, flung himself back into his corner, and looked
resolutely in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>By this time we were half-way to Paris, and the student,
satisfied with his success, packed up his folio, brought out a
great meerschaum with a snaky tube, and smoked like a
factory-chimney.</p>
<p>When we alighted, it was nearly five o'clock.</p>
<p>"What shall we do next?" said Dalrymple, pulling drearily at his
moustache. "I am so deuced dull to-day that I am ashamed to ask
anybody to do me the charity to dine with me--especially a <i>bon
gar&ccedil;on</i> like Herr M&uuml;ller."</p>
<p>"Don't be ashamed," said the student, laughingly, "I would dine
with Pluto himself, if the dishes were good and my appetite as
sharp as to-day."</p>
<p>"<i>Allons</i>, then! Where shall we go; to the <i>Trois
Fr&egrave;res</i>, or the <i>Moulin Rouge</i>, or the <i>Maison
Dor&eacute;e</i>?"</p>
<p>"The <i>Trois Fr&egrave;res</i>" said M&uuml;ller, with the air
of one who deliberates on the fate of nations, "has the
disadvantage of being situated in the Palais Royal, where the band
still continues to play at half-past five every afternoon. Now,
music should come on with the sweets and the champagne. It is not
appropriate with soup or fish, and it distracts one's attention if
injudiciously administered with the made dishes,"</p>
<p>"True. Then shall we try the <i>Moulin Rouge</i>?"</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller shook his head.</p>
<p>"At the <i>Moulin Rouge</i>" said he, gravely, "one can
breakfast well; but their dinners are stereotyped. For the last ten
years they have not added a new dish to their <i>carte</i>; and the
discovery of a new dish, says Brillat Savarin, is of more
importance to the human race than the discovery of a new planet.
No--I should not vote for the <i>Moulin Rouge</i>."</p>
<p>"Well, then, V&eacute;fours, V&eacute;ry's, the Caf&eacute;
Anglais?"</p>
<p>"V&eacute;fours is traditional; the Caf&eacute; Anglais is
infested with English; and at V&eacute;ry's, which is otherwise a
meritorious establishment, one's digestion is disturbed by the
sight of omnivorous provincials, who drink champagne with the
<i>r&ocirc;ti</i>, and eat melon at dessert."</p>
<p>Dalrymple laughed outright.</p>
<p>"At this rate," said he, "we shall get no dinner at all! What is
to become of us, if neither V&eacute;ry's, nor the <i>Trois
Fr&egrave;res</i>, nor the <i>Moulin Rouge</i>, nor the <i>Maison
Dor&eacute;e</i>...."</p>
<p>"<i>Halte-l&agrave;!"</i> interrupted the student, theatrically;
"for by my halidom, sirs, I said not a syllable in disparagement of
the house yelept Dor&eacute;e! Is it not there that we eat of the
crab of Bordeaux, succulent and roseate? Is it not there that we
drink of Veuve Cliquot the costly, and of that Johannisberger, to
which all other hocks are vinegar and water? Never let it be said
that Franz M&uuml;ller, being of sound mind and body, did less than
justice to the reputation of the <i>Maison Dor&eacute;e</i>."</p>
<p>"To the <i>Maison Dor&eacute;e</i>, then," said Dalrymple, "with
what speed and appetite we may! By Jove! Herr Franz, you are a
<i>connoisseur</i> in the matter of dining."</p>
<p>"A man who for twenty-nine days out of every thirty pays his
sixty-five centimes for two dishes at a student's Restaurant in the
Quartier Latin, knows better than most people where to go for a
good dinner when he has the chance," said M&uuml;ller,
philosophically. "The rago&ucirc;ts of the Temple--the
<i>arlequins</i> of the <i>Cit&eacute;</i>--the fried fish of the
Od&eacute;on arcades--the unknown hashes of the <i>guingettes</i>,
and the 'funeral baked meats' of the Palais Royal, are all familiar
to my pocket and my palate. I do not scruple to confess that in
cases of desperate emergency, I have even availed myself of the
advantages of <i>Le hasard</i>."</p>
<p>"<i>Le hasard</i>." said I. "What is that?"</p>
<p>"<i>Le hasard de la fourchette</i>," replied the student, "is
the resort of the vagabond, the <i>gamin</i>, and the
<i>chiffonier</i>. It lies down by the river-side, near the Halles,
and consists of nothing but a shed, a fire, and a caldron. In this
caldron a seething sea of oleaginous liquid conceals an infinite
variety of animal and vegetable substances. The arrangements of the
establishment are beautifully simple. The votary pays his five
centimes and is armed by the presiding genius of the place with a
huge two-pronged iron fork. This fork he plunges in once;--he may
get a calf's foot, or a potato, or a sheep's head, or a carrot, or
a cabbage, or nothing, as fate and the fork direct. All men are
gamblers in some way or another, and <i>Le hasard</i> is a game of
gastronomic chance. But from the ridiculous to the sublime, it is
but a step--and while talking of <i>Le hasard</i> behold, we have
arrived at the <i>Maison Dor&eacute;e</i>."</p>

<h3>A DINNER AT THE MAISON DOR&Eacute;E AND AN EVENING PARTY IN THE
QUARTIER LATIN.</h3>
<br>
<p>The most genial of companions was our new acquaintance, Franz
M&uuml;ller, the art-student. Light-hearted, buoyant, unassuming,
he gave his animal spirits full play, and was the life of our
little dinner. He had more natural gayety than generally belongs to
the German character, and his good-temper was inexhaustible. He
enjoyed everything; he made the best of everything; he saw food for
laughter in everything. He was always amused, and therefore was
always amusing. Above all, there was a spontaneity in his mirth
which acted upon others as a perpetual stimulant. He was in short,
what the French call a <i>bon gar&ccedil;on</i>, and the English a
capital fellow; easy without assurance, comic without vulgarity,
and, as Sydney Smith wittily hath it--"a great number of other
things without a great number of other things."</p>
<p>Upon Dalrymple, who had been all day silent, abstracted, and
unlike his usual self, this joyous influence acted like a tonic. As
entertainer, he was bound to exert himself, and the exertion did
him good. He threw off his melancholy; and with the help, possibly,
of somewhat more than his usual quantity of wine, entered
thoroughly into the passing joyousness of the hour. What a
<i>recherch&eacute;</i>, luxurious extravagant little dinner it
was, that evening at the Maison Dor&eacute;e! We had a charming
little room overlooking the Boulevard, furnished with as much
looking-glass, crimson-velvet, gilding, and arabesque painting as
could be got together within the space of twelve-feet by eight. Our
wine came to table in a silver cooler that Cellini might have
wrought. Our meats were served upon porcelain that would have
driven Palissy to despair. We had nothing that was in season,
except game, and everything that was out; which, by-the-way,
appears to be our modern criterion of excellence with respect to a
dinner. Finally, we were waited upon by the most imposing of
waiters--a waiter whose imperturbable gravity was not to be shaken
by any amount of provocation, and whose neckcloth alone was
sufficient to qualify him for the church.</p>
<p>How merry we were! How M&uuml;ller tormented that diplomatic
waiter! What stories we told! what puns we made! What brilliant
things we said, or fancied we said, over our Chambertin and
Johannisberger! M&uuml;ller knew nothing of the substratum of
sadness underlying all that jollity. He little thought how heavy
Dalrymple's strong heart had been that morning. He had no idea that
my friend and I were to part on the morrow, for months or years, as
the case might be--he to carry his unrest hither and thither
through distant lands; I to remain alone in a strange city,
pursuing a distasteful study, and toiling onward to a future
without fascination or hope. But, as the glass seals tell us, "such
is life." We are all mysteries to one another. The pleasant fellow
whom I invite to dinner because he amuses me, carries a scar on his
soul which it would frighten me to see; and he in turn, when he
praises my claret, little dreams of the carking care that poisons
it upon my palate, and robs it of all its aroma. Perhaps the
laughter-loving painter himself had his own little tragedy locked
up in some secret corner of the heart that seemed to beat so
lightly under that braided blouse of Palais Royal cut and Quartier
Latin fashion! Who could tell? And of what use would it be, if it
were told? Smiles carry one through the world more agreeably than
tears, and if the skeleton is only kept decently out of sight in
its own unsuspected closet, so much the better for you and me, and
society at large.</p>
<p>Dinner over, and the serious waiter dismissed with the dessert
and the empty bottles, we sat by the open window for a long time,
sipping our coffee, smoking our cigars, and watching the busy life
of the Boulevard below. There the shops were all alight and the
passers-by more numerous than by day. Carriages were dashing along,
full of opera-goers and ball-room beauties. On the pavement just
under our window were seated the usual crowd of Boulevard idlers,
sipping their <i>al fresco</i> absinthe, and <i>grog-au-vin.</i> In
the very next room, divided from us by only a slender partition,
was a noisy party of young men and girls. We could hear their
bursts of merriment, the chinking of their glasses as they pledged
one another, the popping of the champagne corks, and almost the
very jests that passed from lip to lip. Presently a band came and
played at the corner of an adjoining street. All was mirth, all was
life, all was amusement and dissipation both in-doors and
out-of-doors, in the "care-charming" city of Paris on that pleasant
September night; and we, of course, were gay and noisy, like our
neighbors. Dalrymple and M&uuml;ller could scarcely be called new
acquaintances. They had met some few times at the <i>Chicards</i>,
and also, some years before, in Rome. What stories they told of
artists whom they had known! What fun they made of Academic dons
and grave professors high in authority! What pictures they drew, of
life in Rome--in Vienna--in Paris! Though we had no ladies of our
party and were only three in number, I am not sure that the
merry-makers in the next room laughed any louder or oftener than
we!</p>
<p>At length the clock on the mantelpiece warned us that it was
already half-past nine, and that we had been three hours at dinner.
It was clearly time to vary the evening's amusement in some way or
other, and the only question was what next to do? Should we go to a
billiard-room? Or to the Salle Valentinois? Or to some of the cheap
theatres on the Boulevard du Temple? Or to the Tableaux Vivants? Or
the Caf&eacute; des Aveugles? Or take a drive round by the Champs
Elys&eacute;es in an open fly?</p>
<p>At length M&uuml;ller remembered that some fellow-students were
giving a party that evening, and offered to introduce us.</p>
<p>"It is up five pairs of stairs, in the Quartier Latin," said he;
"but thoroughly jolly--all students and grisettes. They'll be
delighted to see us."</p>
<p>This admirable proposition was no sooner made than acted upon;
so we started immediately, and Dalrymple, who seemed to be well
acquainted with the usages of student-life, proposed that we should
take with us a store of sweetmeats for the ladies.</p>
<p>"There subsists," observed he, "a mysterious elective affinity
between the grisette and the chocolate bon-bon. He who can
skilfully exhibit the latter, is almost certain to win the heart of
the former. Where the chocolate fails, however, the <i>marron
glac&eacute;</i> is an infallible specific. I recommend that we lay
in a liberal supply of both weapons."</p>
<p>"Carried by acclamation," said M&uuml;ller. "We can buy them on
our way, in the Rue Vivienne. A capital shop; but one that I never
patronize--they give no credit."</p>
<p>Chatting thus, and laughing, we made our way across the
Boulevard and through a net-work of by-streets into the Rue
Vivienne, where we laid siege to a great bon-bon shop--a gigantic
depot for dyspepsia at so much per kilogramme--and there filled our
pockets with sweets of every imaginable flavor and color. This
done, a cab conveyed us in something less than ten minutes across
the Pont Neuf to the Quartier Latin.</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller's friends were three in number, and all
students--one of art, one of law, and one of medicine. They lodged
at the top of a dingy house near the Od&eacute;on, and being very
great friends and very near neighbors were giving this
entertainment conjointly. Their names were Gustave, Jules, and
Adrien. Adrien was the artist, and lived in the garret, just over
the heads of Gustave and Jules, which made it very convenient for a
party, and placed a <i>suite</i> of rooms at the disposal of their
visitors.</p>
<p>Long before we had achieved the five pairs of stairs, we heard
the sound of voices and the scraping of a violin, and on the fifth
landing were received by a pretty young lady in a coquettish little
cap, whom M&uuml;ller familiarly addressed as Annette, and who
piloted us into a very small bed-room which was already full of
hats and coats, bonnets, shawls, and umbrellas. Having added our
own paletots and beavers to the general stock, and having each
received a little bit of pasteboard in exchange for the same, we
were shown into the ball-room by Mademoiselle Annette, who appeared
to fill the position of hostess, usher, and general
superintendent.</p>
<p>It was a good-sized room, somewhat low in the ceiling, and
brilliantly lighted with lots of tallow candles in bottles. The
furniture had all been cleared out for the dancers, except a row of
benches round the walls, and a chest of draws in a recess between
the windows which served as a raised platform for the orchestra.
The said orchestra consisted of a violin and accordion, both played
by amateurs, with an occasional <i>obligato</i> on the common comb.
As for the guests, they were, as M&uuml;ller had already told us,
all students and grisettes--the former wearing every strange
variety of beard and blouse; the latter in pretty light-colored
muslins and bewitching little caps, with the exception of two who
wore flowers in their hair, and belonged to the opera ballet. They
were in the midst of a tremendous galop when we arrived; so we
stood at the door and looked on, and Dalrymple flirted with
Mademoiselle Annette. As soon as the galop was over, two of our
hosts came forward to welcome us.</p>
<p>"The Duke of Dalrymple and the Marquis of Arbuthnot--Messieurs
Jules Charpentier and Gustave Dubois," said M&uuml;ller, with the
most <i>d&eacute;gag&eacute;</i> air in the world.</p>
<p>Monsieur Jules, a tall young man with an enormous false nose of
the regular carnival pattern, and Monsieur Gustave, who was short
and stout, with a visible high-water mark round his throat and
wrists, and curious leather mosaics in his boots, received us very
cordially, and did not appear to be in the least surprised at the
magnificence of the introduction. On the contrary, they shook hands
with us; apologized for the absence of Adrien, who was preparing
the supper upstairs; and offered to find us partners for the next
valse. Dalrymple immediately proposed for the hand of Mademoiselle
Annette. M&uuml;ller, declining adventitious aid, wandered among
the ladies, making himself universally agreeable and trusting for a
partner to his own unassisted efforts. For myself, I was indebted
to Monsieur Gustave for an introduction to a very charming young
lady whose name was Josephine, and with whom I fell over head and
ears in love without a moment's warning.</p>
<p>She was somewhat under the middle height, slender, supple,
rosy-lipped, and coquettish to distraction. Her pretty mouth
dimpled round with smiles at every word it uttered. Her very eyes
laughed. Her hair, which was more adorned than concealed by a tiny
muslin cap that clung by some unseen agency to the back of her
head, was of a soft, warm, wavy brown, with a woof of gold
threading it here and there. Her voice was perhaps a little loud;
her conversation rather childish; her accent such as would scarcely
have passed current in the Faubourg St. Germain--but what of that?
One would be worse than foolish to expect style and cultivation in
a grisette; and had I not had enough to disgust me with both in
Madame de Marignan? What more charming, after all, than youth,
beauty, and lightheartedness? Were Noel and Chapsal of any
importance to a mouth that could not speak without such a smile as
Hebe might have envied?</p>
<p>I was, at all events, in no mood to take exception to these
little defects. I am not sure that I did not even regard them in
the light of additional attractions. That which in another I should
have called <i>b&ecirc;te</i>, I set down to the score of
<i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> in Mademoiselle Josephine. One is not
diffident at twenty--by the way, I was now twenty-one--especially
after dining at the Maison Dor&eacute;e.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle Josephine was frankness itself. Before I had
enjoyed the pleasure of her acquaintance for ten minutes, she told
me she was an artificial florist; that her <i>patronne</i> lived in
the Rue M&eacute;nilmontant; that she went to her work every
morning at nine, and left it every evening at eight; that she
lodged <i>sous les toits</i> at No. 70, Rue Aubry-le-Boucher; that
her relations lived at Juvisy; and that she went to see them now
and then on Sundays, when the weather and her funds permitted.</p>
<p>"Is the country pretty at Juvisy, Mademoiselle?" I asked, by way
of keeping up the conversation.</p>
<p>"Oh, M'sieur, it is a real paradise. There are trees and fields,
and there is the Seine close by, and a ch&acirc;teau, and a park,
and a church on a hill, ... <i>ma foi!</i> there is nothing in
Paris half so pretty; not even the Jardin des Plantes!"</p>
<p>"And have you been there lately?"</p>
<p>"Not for eight weeks, at the very least, M'sieur. But then it
costs three francs and a half for the return ticket, and since I
quarrelled with Emile...."</p>
<p>"Emile!" said I, quickly. "Who is he?"</p>
<p>"He is a picture-frame maker, M'sieur, and works for a great
dealer in the Rue du Faubourg Montmartre. He was my sweetheart, and
he took me out somewhere every Sunday, till we quarrelled."</p>
<p>"And what did you quarrel about, Mademoiselle?"</p>
<p>My pretty partner laughed and tossed her head.</p>
<p>"Eh, <i>mon Dieu</i>! he was jealous."</p>
<p>"Jealous of whom?"</p>
<p>"Of a gentleman--an artist--who wanted to paint me in one of his
pictures. Emile did not like me to go to his <i>atelier</i> so
often; and the gentleman gave me a shawl (such a pretty shawl!) and
a canary in a lovely green and gold cage; and...."</p>
<p>"And Emile objected ?"</p>
<p>"Yes, M'sieur."</p>
<p>"How very unreasonable!"</p>
<p>"That's just what I said, M'sieur."</p>
<p>"And have you never seen him since!"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes--he keeps company now with my cousin Cecile, and she
humors him in everything,"</p>
<p>"And the artist--what of him, Mademoiselle?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I sat to him every day, till his picture was finished.
<i>Il &eacute;tait bien gentil</i>. He took me to the theatre
several times, and once to a f&ecirc;te at Versailles; but that was
after Emile and I had broken it off."</p>
<p>"Did you find it tiresome, sitting as a model?"</p>
<p>"<i>Mais, comme ci, et comme &ccedil;a</i>! It was a beautiful
dress, and became me wonderfully. To be sure, it was rather
cold!"</p>
<p>"May I ask what character you were supposed to represent,
Mademoiselle?"</p>
<p>"He said it was Phryne. I have no idea who she was; but I think
she must have found it very uncomfortable if she always wore
sandals, and went without stockings."</p>
<p>I looked down at her little foot, and thought how pretty it must
have looked in the Greek sandal. I pictured her to myself in the
graceful Greek robe, with a chalice in her hand and her temples
crowned with flowers. What a delicious Phryne! And what a happy
fellow Praxiteles must have been!</p>
<p>"It was a privilege, Mademoiselle, to be allowed to see you in
so charming a costume," I said, pressing her hand tenderly. "I envy
that artist from the bottom of my heart."</p>
<p>Mademoiselle Josephine smiled, and returned the pressure.</p>
<p>"One might borrow it," said she, "for the Bal de
l'Op&eacute;ra."</p>
<p>"Ah, Mademoiselle, if I dared only aspire to the honor of
conducting you!"</p>
<p>"<i>Dame</i>! it is nearly four months to come!"</p>
<p>"True, but in the meantime, Mademoiselle----"</p>
<p>"In the meantime," said the fair Josephine, anticipating my
hopes with all the unembarrassed straightforwardness imaginable, "I
shall be delighted to improve M'sieur's acquaintance."</p>
<p>"Mademoiselle, you make me happy!"</p>
<p>"Besides, M'sieur is an Englishman, and I like the English so
much!"</p>
<p>"I am delighted to hear it, Mademoiselle. I hope I shall never
give you cause to alter your opinion."</p>
<p>"Last galop before supper!" shouted Monsieur Jules through, a
brass speaking-trumpet, in order to make use of which he was
obliged to hold up his nose with one hand. "Gentlemen, choose your
partners. All couples to dance till they drop!"</p>
<p>There were a dozen up immediately, amongst whom Dalrymple and
Mademoiselle Annette, and M&uuml;ller with one of the ballet
ladies, were the first to start. As for Josephine, she proved to be
a damsel of forty-galop power. She never wanted to rest, and she
never cared to leave off. She did not even look warm when it was
over. I wonder to this day how it was that I did not die on the
spot.</p>
<p>When the galop was ended, we all went upstairs to Monsieur
Adrien's garret, where Monsieur Adrien, who had red hair and wore
glasses, received us in person, and made us welcome. Here we found
the supper elegantly laid out on two doors which had been taken off
their hinges for the purpose; but which, being supported from
beneath on divers boxes and chairs of unequal heights, presented a
painfully sloping surface, thereby causing the jellies to look like
leaning towers of Pisa, and the spongecake (which was already
professedly tipsy) to assume an air so unbecomingly convivial that
it might almost have been called drunk.</p>
<p>Nobody thought of sitting down, and, if they did, there were no
means of doing so; for Monsieur Adrien's garret was none of the
largest, and, as in a small villa residence we sometimes see the
whole house sacrificed to a winding staircase, so in this instance
had the whole room been sacrificed to the splendor of the supper.
For the inconvenience of standing, we were compensated, however, by
the abundance and excellence of the fare. There were cold chickens,
meat-pies, dishes of sliced ham, pyramids of little Bologna
sausages, huge rolls of bread a yard in length, lobster salad, and
cold punch in abundance.</p>
<p>The flirtations at supper were tremendous. In a bachelor
establishment one cannot expect to find every convenience, and on
this occasion the prevailing deficiencies were among the plates and
glasses; so those who had been partners in the dance now became
partners in other matters, eating off the same plate and drinking
out of the same tumbler; but this only made it so much the merrier.
By and by somebody volunteered a song, and somebody else made a
speech, and then we went down again to the ball-room, and dancing
recommenced.</p>
<p>The laughter now became louder, and the legs of the guests more
vigorous than ever. The orchestra, too, received an addition to its
strength in the person of a gentleman who, having drunk more cold
punch than was quite consistent with the preservation of his
equilibrium, was still sober enough to oblige us with a spirited
accompaniment on the shovel and tongs, which, with the violin and
accordion, and the comb <i>obligato</i> before mentioned, produced
a startling effect, and reminded one of Turkish marches, Pantomime
overtures, and the like barbaric music.</p>
<p>In the midst of the first polka, however, we were interrupted by
a succession of furious double knocks on the floor beneath our
feet. We stopped by involuntary consent--dancers, musicians, and
all.</p>
<p>"It's our neighbor on the story below," said Monsieur Jules. "He
objects to the dancing."</p>
<p>"Then we'll dance a little heavier, to teach him better taste,"
said a student, who had so little hair on his head and so much on
his chin, that he looked as if his face had been turned upside
down. "What is the name of the ridiculous monster?"</p>
<p>"Monsieur Bobinet."</p>
<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, let us dance for the edification of
Monsieur Bobinet! Orchestra, strike up, in honor of Monsieur
Bobinet! One, two, three, and away!"</p>
<p>Hereupon we uttered a general hurrah, and dashed off again, like
a herd of young elephants. The knocking ceased, and we thought that
Monsieur Bobinet had resigned himself to his fate, when, just as
the polka ended and the dancers were promenading noisily round and
round the room, the bombardment began afresh; and this time against
the very door of the ball-room.</p>
<p>"<i>Par exemple</i>!" cries Monsieur Jules. "The enemy dares to
attack us in our own lines!"</p>
<p>"Bolt the door, and let him knock till he's tired," suggested
one.</p>
<p>"Open it suddenly, and deluge him with water!" cried
another.</p>
<p>"Tar and feather him!" proposed a third.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Monsieur Bobinet, happily ignorant of these
agreeable schemes for his reception, continued to thunder away upon
the outer panels, accompanying the raps with occasional loud
coughs, and hems, and stampings of the feet.</p>
<p>"Hush! do nothing violent," cried M&uuml;ller, scenting a
practical joke. "Let us invite him in, and make fun of him. It will
be ever so much more amusing!"</p>
<p>And with this he drove the rest somewhat back and threw open the
door, upon the outer threshold of which, with a stick in one hand
and a bedroom candle in the other, and a flowered dressing-gown
tied round his ample waist by a cord and tassels, stood Monsieur
Bobinet.</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller received him with a profound bow, and said:--</p>
<p>"Monsieur Bobinet, I believe?"</p>
<p>Monsieur Bobinet, who was very bald, very cross, and very stout,
cast an irritable glance into the room, but, seeing so many people,
drew back and said:--</p>
<p>"Yes, that is my name, Monsieur. I lodge on the fourth
floor...."</p>
<p>"But pray walk in, Monsieur Bobinet," said M&uuml;ller, opening
the door still wider and bowing still more profoundly.</p>
<p>"Monsieur," returned the fourth-floor lodger, "I--I only come to
complain...."</p>
<p>"Whatever the occasion of this honor, Monsieur," pursued the
student, with increasing politeness, "we cannot suffer you to
remain on the landing. Pray do us the favor to walk in."</p>
<p>"Oh, walk in--pray walk in, Monsieur Bobinet," echoed Jules,
Gustave, and Adrien, all together.</p>
<p>The fourth-floor lodger hesitated; took a step forward; thought,
perhaps, that, since we were all so polite, he would do his best to
conciliate us; and, glancing down nervously at his dressing-gown
and slippers, said:--</p>
<p>"Really, gentlemen, I should have much pleasure, but I am not
prepared...."</p>
<p>"Don't mention it, Monsieur Bobinet," said M&uuml;ller. "We are
delighted to receive you. Allow me to disembarrass you of your
candle."</p>
<p>"And permit me," said Jules, "to relieve you of your stick."</p>
<p>"Pray, Monsieur Bobinet, do you never dance the polka?" asked
Gustave.</p>
<p>"Bring Monsieur Bobinet a glass of cold punch," said Adrien.</p>
<p>"And a plate of lobster salad," added the bearded student.</p>
<p>Monsieur Bobinet, finding the door already closed behind him,
looked round nervously; but encountering only polite and smiling
faces, endeavored to seem at his ease, and to put a good face upon
the matter.</p>
<p>"Indeed, gentlemen, I must beg you to excuse me," said he. "I
never drink at night, and I never eat suppers. I only came to
request...."</p>
<p>"Nay, Monsieur Bobinet, we cannot suffer you to leave us without
taking a glass of cold punch," pursued M&uuml;ller.</p>
<p>"Upon my word," began the lodger, "I dare not...."</p>
<p>"A glass of white wine, then?"</p>
<p>"Or a cup of coffee?"</p>
<p>"Or some home-made lemonade?"</p>
<p>Monsieur Bobinet cast a look of helpless longing towards the
door.</p>
<p>"If you really insist, gentlemen," said he, "I will take a cup
of coffee; but indeed...."</p>
<p>"A cup of coffee for Monsieur Bobinet!" shouted M&uuml;ller.</p>
<p>"A large cup of coffee for Monsieur Bobinet!" repeated
Jules.</p>
<p>"A strong cup of coffee for Monsieur Bobinet!" cried Gustave,
following up the lead of the other two.</p>
<p>The fourth-floor lodger frowned and colored up, beginning to be
suspicious of mischief. Seeing this, M&uuml;ller hastened to
apologize.</p>
<p>"You must pardon us, Monsieur Bobinet," he said with the most
winning amiability, "if we are all in unusually high spirits
to-night. You are not aware, perhaps, that our friend Monsieur
Jules Charpentier was married this morning, and that we are here in
celebration of that happy event. Allow me to introduce you to the
bride."</p>
<p>And turning to one of the ballet ladies, he led her forward with
exceeding gravity, and presented her to Monsieur Bobinet as Madame
Charpentier.</p>
<p>The fourth-floor lodger bowed, and went through the usual
congratulations. In the meantime, some of the others had prepared a
mock sofa by means of two chairs set somewhat wide apart, with a
shawl thrown over the whole to conceal the space between. Upon one
of these chairs sat a certain young lady named Louise, and upon the
other Mam'selle Josephine. As soon as it was ready, Muller, who had
been only waiting for it, affected to observe for the first time
that Monsieur Bobinet was still standing.</p>
<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>!" he exclaimed, "has no one offered our visitor
a chair? Monsieur Bobinet, I beg a thousand pardons. Pray do us the
favor to be seated. Your coffee will be here immediately, and these
ladies on the sofa will be delighted to make room for you."</p>
<p>"Oh yes, pray be seated, Monsieur Bobinet," cried the two girls.
"We shall be charmed to make room for Monsieur Bobinet!"</p>
<p>More than ever confused and uncomfortable, poor Monsieur Bobinet
bowed; sat down upon the treacherous space between the two chairs;
went through immediately; and presented the soles of his slippers
to the company in the least picturesque manner imaginable. This
involuntary performance was greeted with a shout of wild
delight.</p>
<p>"Bravo, Monsieur Bobinet!"</p>
<p>"<i>Vive</i> Monsieur Bobinet!"</p>
<p>"Three cheers for Monsieur Bobinet!"</p>
<p>Scarlet with rage, the fourth-floor lodger sprang to his feet
and made a rush to the door; but he was hemmed in immediately. In
vain he stormed; in vain he swore. We joined hands; we called for
music; we danced round him; we sang; and at last, having fairly
bumped and thumped and hustled him till we were tired, pushed him
out on the landing, and left him to his fate.</p>
<p>After this interlude, the mirth grew fast and furious.
<i>Valse</i> succeeded <i>valse</i>, and galop followed galop, till
the orchestra declared they could play no longer, and the gentleman
with the shovel and tongs collapsed in a corner of the room and
went to sleep with his head in the coal-scuttle. Then the
ballet-ladies were prevailed upon to favor us with a <i>pas de
deux</i>; after which M&uuml;ller sang a comic song with a chorus,
in which everybody joined; and then the orchestra was bribed with
hot brandy-and-water, and dancing commenced again. By this time the
visitors began to drop away in twos and threes, and even the fair
Josephine, to whom I had never ceased paying the most devoted
attention, declared she could not stir another step. As for
Dalrymple, he had disappeared during supper, without a word of
leave-taking to any one.</p>
<p>Matters being at this pass, I looked at my watch, and found that
it was already half-past six o'clock; so, having bade good-night,
or rather good-morning, to Messieurs Jules, Gustave, and Adrien,
and having, with great difficulty, discovered my own coat and hat
among the miscellaneous collection in the adjoining bed-room, I
prepared to escort Mademoiselle Josephine to her home.</p>
<p>"Going already?" said M&uuml;ller, encountering us on the
landing, with a roll in one hand and a Bologna sausage in the
other.</p>
<p>"Already! Why, my dear fellow, it is nearly seven o'clock!"</p>
<p>"<i>Qu'importe</i>? Come up to the supper-room and have some
breakfast!"</p>
<p>"Not for the world!"</p>
<p>"Well, <i>chacun &agrave; son go&ucirc;t</i>. I am as hungry as
a hunter."</p>
<p>"Can I not take you any part of your way?"</p>
<p>"No, thank you. I am a Quartier Latinist, <i>pur sang</i>, and
lodge only a street or two off. Stay, here is my address. Come and
see me--you can't think how glad I shall be!"</p>
<p>"Indeed, I will come---and here is my card in exchange.
Good-night, Herr M&uuml;ller."</p>
<p>"Good-night, Marquis of Arbuthnot. Mademoiselle Josephine, <i>au
plaisir</i>."</p>
<p>So we shook hands and parted, and I saw my innamorata home to
her residence at No. 70, Rue Aubry le Boucher, which opened upon
the March&eacute; des Innocents. She fell asleep upon my shoulder
in the cab, and was only just sufficiently awake when I left her,
to accept all the <i>marrons glac&eacute;s</i> that yet remained in
the pockets of my paletot, and to remind me that I had promised to
take her out next Sunday for a drive in the country, and a dinner
at the Moulin Rouge.</p>
<p>The fountain in the middle of the March&eacute; was now
sparkling in the sunshine like a shower of diamonds, and the
business of the market was already at its height. The shops in the
neighboring streets were opening fast. The "iron tongue" of St.
Eustache was calling the devout to early prayer. Fagged as I was, I
felt that a walk through the fresh air would do me good; so I
dismissed the cab, and reached my lodgings just as the sleepy
<i>concierge</i> had turned out to sweep the hall, and open the
establishment for the day. When I came down again two hours later,
after a nap and a bath, I found a <i>commissionnaire</i> waiting
for me.</p>
<p>"<i>Tiens</i>!" said Madame Bou&iuml;sse (Madame Bou&iuml;sse
was the wife of the <i>concierge</i>). "<i>V'la</i>! here is
M'sieur Arbuthnot."</p>
<p>The man touched his cap, and handed me a letter.</p>
<p>"I was told to deliver it into no hands but those of M'sieur
himself," said he.</p>
<p>The address was in Dalrymple's writing. I tore the envelope
open. It contained only a card, on the back of which, scrawled
hastily in pencil, were the following words:</p>
<p>"To have said good-bye would have made our parting none the
lighter. By the time you decipher this hieroglyphic I shall be some
miles on my way: Address H&ocirc;tel de Russie, Berlin. Adieu,
Damon; God bless you. O.D."</p>
<p>"How long is it since this letter was given to you?" said I,
without taking my eyes from the card.</p>
<p>The <i>commissionnaire</i> made no reply. I repeated the
question, looked up impatiently, and found that the man was already
gone.</p>

<h3>THE CHATEAU DE SAINTE AULAIRE.</h3>
<center>"Mark yon old mansion frowning through the trees,<br>
Whose hollow turret wooes the whistling breeze."</center>
<br>
<p>My acquaintance with Mademoiselle Josephine progressed rapidly;
although, to confess the truth, I soon found myself much less
deeply in love than I had at first supposed. For this
disenchantment, fate and myself were alone to blame. It was not her
fault if I had invested her with a thousand imaginary perfections;
nor mine if the spell was broken as soon as I discovered my
mistake.</p>
<p>Too impatient to wait till Sunday, I made my way on Saturday
afternoon to Rue Aubry-le-Boucher. I persuaded myself that I was
bound to call on her, in order to conclude our arrangements for the
following day. At all events, I argued, she might forget the
engagement, or believe that I had forgotten it. So I went, taking
with me a magnificent bouquet, and an embroidered satin bag full of
<i>marrons glac&eacute;s</i>.</p>
<p>My divinity lived, as she had told me, <i>sous les
toits</i>--and <i>sous les toits</i>, up seven flights of very
steep and dirty stairs, I found her. It was a large attic with a
sloping roof, overlooking a bristling expanse of chimney-pots, and
commanding the twin towers of Notre Dame. There were some colored
prints of battles and shipwrecks wafered to the walls; a couple of
flower-pots in the narrow space between the window-ledge and the
coping outside; a dingy canary in a wire cage; a rival mechanical
cuckoo in a Dutch clock in the corner; a little bed with striped
hangings; a rush-bottomed <i>prie-dieu</i> chair in front of a
plain black crucifix, over which drooped a faded branch of
consecrated palm; and some few articles of household furniture of
the humblest description. In all this there was nothing vulgar.
Under other circumstances I might, perhaps, have even elicited
somewhat of grace and poetry from these simple materials. But
conceive what it was to see them through an atmosphere of warm
white steam that left an objectionable clamminess on the backs of
the chairs and caused even the door-handle to burst into a tepid
perspiration. Conceive what it was to behold my adored one standing
in the middle of the room, up to her elbows in soap-suds, washing
out the very dress in which she was to appear on the morrow....
Good taste defend us! Could anything be more cruelly calculated to
disturb the tender tenor of a lover's dreams? Fancy what Leander
would have felt, if, after swimming across the Hellespont, he had
surprised Hero at the washing-tub! Imagine Romeo's feelings, if he
had scaled the orchard-walls only to find Juliet helping to hang
out the family linen!</p>
<p>The worst of it was that my lovely Josephine was not in the
least embarrassed. She evidently regarded the washing-tub as a
desirable piece of furniture, and was not even conscious that the
act of "soaping in," was an unromantic occupation!</p>
<p>Such was the severity of this first blow that I pleaded an
engagement, presented my offerings (how dreadfully inappropriate
they seemed!), and hurried away to a lecture on <i>materia
medica</i> at the <i>&Eacute;cole Pratique</i>; that being a good,
congenial, dismal entertainment for the evening!</p>
<p>Sunday came with the sunrise, and at midday, true as the clock
of St. Eustache, I knocked once more at the door of the
<i>mansarde</i> where my Josephine dwelt. This time, my visit being
anticipated, I found her dressed to receive me. She looked more
fresh and charming than ever; and the lilac muslin which I had seen
in the washing-tub some eighteen or twenty hours before, became her
to perfection. So did her pretty green shawl, pinned closely at the
throat and worn as only a French-woman would have known how to wear
it. So did the white camellia and the moss-rose buds which she had
taken out of my bouquet, and fastened at her waist.</p>
<p>What I was not prepared for, however, was her cap. I had
forgotten that your Parisian grisette<a name=
"FNanchor1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1">[1]</a> would no more dream
of wearing a bonnet than of crowning her head with feathers and
adorning her countenance with war-paint. It had totally escaped me
that I, a bashful Englishman of twenty-one, nervously sensitive to
ridicule and gifted by nature with but little of the spirit of
social defiance, must in broad daylight make my appearance in the
streets of Paris, accompanied by a bonnetless grisette! What should
I do, if I met Dr. Ch&eacute;ron? or Madame de Courcelles? or,
worse than all, Madame de Marignan? My obvious resource was to take
her in whatever direction we should be least likely to meet any of
my acquaintances. Where, oh fate! might that obscurity be found
which had suddenly become the dearest object of my desires?</p>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor1">[1]</a>
The grisette of twenty years ago, <i>bien entendu</i>. I am
writing, be it remembered, of "The days of my youth."</blockquote>
<p>"<i>Eh bien</i>, Monsieur Basil," said Josephine, when my first
compliments had been paid. "I am quite ready. Where are we
going?"</p>
<p>"We shall dine, <i>mon cher ange</i>," said I, absently,
"at--let me see--at...."</p>
<p>"At the Moulin Rouge," interrupted she. "But that is six hours
to come. In the meantime--"</p>
<p>"In the meantime? Ay, in the meantime...what a delightful day
for the time of year!"</p>
<p>"Shall it be Versailles?" suggested Josephine.</p>
<p>"Heaven forbid!"</p>
<p>Josephine opened her large eyes.</p>
<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i>" said she. "What is there so very dreadful in
Versailles?"</p>
<p>I made no reply. I was passing all the suburbs in review before
my mind's eye,--Bellevue, Enghien, Fontenay-aux-Roses, St.
Germains, Sceaux; even Fontainebleau and Compi&egrave;gne.</p>
<p>The grisette pouted, and glanced at the clock.</p>
<p>"If Monsieur is as slow to start as he is to answer," said she,
"we shall not get beyond the barriers to-day."</p>
<p>At this moment, I remembered to have heard of Montlh&eacute;ry
as a place where there was a forest and a feudal ruin; also, which
was more to the purpose, as lying at least six-and-twenty miles
south of Paris.</p>
<p>"My dear Mademoiselle Josephine," I said, "forgive me. I have
planned an excursion which I am sure will please you infinitely
better than a mere common-place trip to Versailles. Versailles, on
Sunday, is vulgar. You have heard, of course, of
Montlh&eacute;ry--one of the most interesting places near
Paris."</p>
<p>"I have read a romance called <i>The Tower of
Montlh&eacute;ry"</i> said Josephine.</p>
<p>"And that tower--that historical and interesting tower--is still
standing! How delightful to wander among the ruins--to recall the
stirring events which caused it to be besieged in the reign of--of
either Louis the Eleventh, or Louis the Fourteenth; I don't
remember which, and it doesn't signify--to explore the picturesque
village, and ramble through the adjoining woods of St.
Genevi&egrave;ve--to visit..."</p>
<p>"I wonder if we shall find any donkeys to ride," interrupted
Josephine, upon whom my eloquence was taking the desired
effect.</p>
<p>"Donkeys!" I exclaimed, drawing, I am ashamed to say, upon my
imagination. "Of course--hundreds of them!"</p>
<p>"<i>Ah, &ccedil;a</i>! Then the sooner we go the better. Stay, I
must just lock my door, and leave word with my neighbor on the next
floor that I am gone out for the day,"</p>
<p>So she locked the door and left the message, and we started. I
was fortunate enough to find a close cab at the corner of the
<i>march&eacute;</i>--she would have preferred an open one, but I
overruled that objection on the score of time--and before very long
we were seated in the cushioned fauteuils of a first-class
compartment on the Orleans Railway, and speeding away towards
Montlh&eacute;ry.</p>
<p>It was with no trifling sense of relief that I found the place
really picturesque, when we arrived. We had, it is true, to put up
with a comfortless drive of three or four miles in a primitive,
jolting, yellow omnibus, which crawled at stated hours of the day
between the town and the station; but that was a minor evil, and we
made the best of it. First of all, we strolled through the
village--the clean, white, sunny village, where the people were
sitting outside their doors playing at dominoes, and the cocks and
hens were walking about like privileged inhabitants of the
market-place. Then we had luncheon at the <i>auberge</i> of the
"Lion d'Or." Then we looked in at the little church (still smelling
of incense from the last service) with its curious old altar-piece
and monumental brasses. Then we peeped through the iron gate of the
melancholy <i>cimeti&egrave;re</i>, which was full of black crosses
and wreaths of <i>immortelles</i>. Last of all, we went to see the
ruin, which stood on the summit of a steep and solitary rock in the
midst of a vast level plain. It proved to be a round keep of
gigantic strength and height, approached by two courtyards and
surrounded by the weed-grown and fragmentary traces of an extensive
stronghold, nothing of which now remained save a few broken walls,
three or four embrasured loopholes, an ancient well of incalculable
depth, and the rusted teeth of a formidable portcullis. Here we
paused awhile to rest and admire the view; while Josephine, pleased
as a child on a holiday, flung pebbles into the well, ate
sugar-plums, and amused herself with my pocket-telescope.</p>
<p>"<i>Regardez</i>!" she cried, "there is the dome of the
Panth&eacute;on. I am sure it is the Panth&eacute;on--and to the
right, far away, I see a town!--little white houses, and a steeple.
And there goes a steamer on the river--and there is the railway and
the railway station, and the long road by which we came in the
omnibus. Oh, how nice it is, Monsieur Basil, to look through a
telescope!"</p>
<p>"Do me the favor, <i>ma belle</i>, to accept it--for my sake,"
said I, thankful to find her so easily entertained. I was lying in
a shady angle of old wall, puffing away at a cigar, with my hat
over my eyes, and the soles of my boots levelled at the view. It is
difficult to smoke and make love at the same time; and I preferred
the tobacco.</p>
<p>Josephine was enchanted, and thanked me in a thousand pretty,
foolish phrases. She declared she saw ever so much farther and
clearer with the glass, now that it was her own. She looked at me
through it, and insisted that I should look at her. She picked out
all sorts of marvellous objects, at all sorts of incredible
distances. In short, she prattled and chattered till I forgot all
about the washing-tub, and again began to think her quite charming.
Presently we heard wandering sounds of music among the trees at the
foot of the hill--sounds as of a violin and bagpipes; now coming
with the wind from the west, now dying away to the north, now
bursting out afresh more merrily than ever, and leading off towards
the village.</p>
<p>"<i>Tiens</i>! that must be a wedding!" said Josephine, drumming
with her little feet against the side of the old well on which she
was sitting.</p>
<p>"A wedding! what connection subsists, pray, between the bonds of
matrimony, and a tune on the bagpipes?"</p>
<p>"I don't know what you mean by bagpipes--I only know that when
people get married in the country, they go about with the musicians
playing before them. What you hear yonder is a violin and a
<i>cornemuse</i>."</p>
<p>"A <i>cornemuse!</i>" I repeated. "What's that?"</p>
<p>"Oh, country music. A thing you blow into with your mouth, and
play upon with your fingers, and squeeze under your arm--like
this."</p>
<p>"Then it's the same thing, <i>ma ch&egrave;re</i>," said I. "A
bagpipes and a <i>cornemuse</i>--a <i>cornemuse</i> and bagpipes.
Both of them national, popular, and frightful."</p>
<p>"I'm so fond of music," said Josephine.</p>
<p>Not wishing to object to her tastes, and believing that this
observation related to the music then audible, I made no reply.</p>
<p>"And I have never been to an opera," added she.</p>
<p>I was still silent, though from another motive.</p>
<p>"You will take me one night to the Italiens, or the Op&eacute;ra
Comique, will you not, Monsieur Basil?" pursued she, determined not
to lose her opportunity.</p>
<p>I had now no resource but to promise; which I did, very
reluctantly.</p>
<p>"You would enjoy the Op&eacute;ra Comique far more than the
Italiens," said I, remembering that Madame de Marignan had a box at
the Italiens, and rapidly weighing the chances for and against the
possibility of recognition. "At the first they sing in French--at
the last, in Italian,"</p>
<p>"Ah, bah! I should prefer the French," replied she, falling at
once into the snare. "When shall it be--this week?"</p>
<p>"Ye--es; one evening this week."</p>
<p>"What evening?"</p>
<p>"Well, let me see--we had better wait, and consult the
advertisements."</p>
<p>"<i>Dame</i>! never mind the advertisements. Let it be
Tuesday."</p>
<p>"Why Tuesday?"</p>
<p>"Because it is soon; and because I can get away early on
Tuesdays if I ask leave."</p>
<p>I had, plainly, no chance of escape.</p>
<p>"You would not prefer to see the great military piece at the
Porte St. Martin?" I suggested. "There are three hundred real
soldiers in it, and they fire real cannon."</p>
<p>"Not I! I have been to the Porte St. Martin, over and over
again. Emile knew one of the scene-painter's assistants, and used
to get tickets two or three times a month."</p>
<p>"Then it shall be the Opera Comique," said I, with a sigh.</p>
<p>"And on Tuesday evening next."</p>
<p>"On Tuesday evening next."</p>
<p>At this moment the piping and fiddling broke out afresh, and
Josephine, who had scarcely taken the little telescope from her eye
all the time, exclaimed that she saw the wedding party going
through the market-place of the town.</p>
<p>"There they are--the musicians first; the bride and bridegroom
next; and eight friends, all two and two! There will be a dance,
depend on it! Let us go down to the town, and hear all about it!
Perhaps they might invite us to join them--who knows?"</p>
<p>"But you would not dance before dinner?"</p>
<p>"<i>Eh, mon Dieu</i>! I would dance before breakfast, if I had
the chance. Come along. If we do not make haste, we may miss
them."</p>
<p>I rose, feeling, and I daresay, looking, like a martyr; and we
went down again into the town.</p>
<p>There we inquired of the first person who seemed likely to
know--he was a dapper hairdresser, standing at his shop-door with
his hands in his apron pockets and a comb behind his ear--and were
told that the wedding-party had just passed through the village, on
their way to the Chateau of Saint Aulaire.</p>
<p>"The Chateau of St. Aulaire!" said Josephine. "What are they
going to do there? What is there to see?"</p>
<p>"It is an ancient mansion, Mademoiselle, much visited by
strangers," replied the hairdresser with exceeding politeness.
"Worthy of Mademoiselle's distinguished attention--and Monsieur's.
Contains old furniture, old paintings, old china--stands in an
extensive park--one of the lions of this neighborhood,
Mademoiselle--also Monsieur."</p>
<p>"To whom does it belong?" I asked, somewhat interested in this
account.</p>
<p>"That, Monsieur, is a question difficult to answer," replied the
fluent hairdresser, running his fingers through his locks and
dispersing a gentle odor of rose-oil. "It was formerly the property
of the ancient family of Saint Aulaire. The last Marquis de Saint
Aulaire, with his wife and family, were guillotined in 1793. Some
say that the young heir was saved; and an individual asserting
himself to be that heir did actually put forward a claim to the
estate, some twenty, or five-and-twenty years ago, but lost his
cause for want of sufficient proof. In the meantime, it had passed
into the hands of a wealthy republican family, descended, it is
said, from General Dumouriez. This family held it till within the
last four years, when two or three fresh claimants came forward; so
that it is now the object of a lawsuit which may last till every
brick of it falls to ruin, and every tree about it withers away. At
present, a man and his wife have charge of the place, and visitors
are permitted to see it any day between twelve and four."</p>
<p>"I should like to see the old place," said I.</p>
<p>"And I should like to see how the bride is dressed," said
Josephine, "and if the bridegroom is handsome."</p>
<p>"Well, let us go--not forgetting to thank Monsieur <i>le
Perruquier</i> for his polite information."</p>
<p>Monsieur <i>le Perruquier</i> fell into what dancing-masters
call the first position, and bowed elaborately.</p>
<p>"Most welcome, Mademoiselle--and Monsieur," said he. "Straight
up the road--past the orchard about a quarter of a mile--old iron
gates--can't miss it. Good-afternoon, Mademoiselle--also
Monsieur."</p>
<p>Following his directions, we came presently to the gates, which
were rusty and broken-hinged, with traces of old gilding still
showing faintly here and there upon their battered scrolls and
bosses. One of them was standing open, and had evidently been
standing so for years; while the other had as evidently been long
closed, so that the deep grass had grown rankly all about it, and
the very bolt was crusted over with a yellow lichen. Between the
two, an ordinary wooden hurdle had been put up, and this hurdle was
opened for us by a little blue-bloused urchin in a pair of huge
<i>sabots</i>, who, thinking we belonged to the bridal party,
pointed up the dusky avenue, and said, with a grin:--</p>
<p>"<i>Tout droit, M'sieur--ils sont pass&eacute;s par
l&agrave;!</i>"</p>
<p><i>Par l&agrave;</i>, "under the shade of melancholy boughs," we
went accordingly. Far away on either side stretched dim vistas of
neglected park-land, deep with coarse grass and weeds and, where
the trees stood thickest, all choked with a brambly undergrowth.
After about a quarter of a mile of this dreary avenue, we came to a
broad area of several acres laid out in the Italian style with
fountains and terraces, at the upper end of which stood the
house--a feudal, <i>moyen-&acirc;ge</i> French chateau, with
irregular wings, steep slated roofings, innumerable windows, and
fantastic steeple-topped turrets sheeted with lead and capped with
grotesque gilded weathercocks. The principal front had been
repaired in the style of the Renaissance and decorated with little
foliated entablatures above the doors and windows; whilst a double
flight of steps leading up to a grand entrance on the level of the
first story, like the famous double staircase of Fontainebleau, had
been patched on in the very centre, to the manifest disfigurement
of the building. Most of the windows were shuttered up, and as we
drew nearer, the general evidences of desolation became more
apparent. The steps of the terraces were covered with patches of
brown and golden moss. The stone urns were some of them fallen in
the deep grass, and some broken. There were gaps in the rich
balustrade here and there; and the two great fountains on either
side of the lower terrace had long since ceased to fling up their
feathery columns towards the sun. In the middle of one a broken
Pan, noseless and armless, turned up a stony face of mute appeal,
as if imploring us to free him from the parasitic jungle of aquatic
plants which flourished rankly round him in the basin. In the
other, a stalwart river-god with his finger on his lip, seemed
listening for the music of those waters which now scarcely stirred
amid the tangled weeds that clustered at his feet.</p>
<p>Passing all these, passing also the flower-beds choked with
brambles and long waving grasses, and the once quaintly-clipped
myrtle and box-trees, all flinging out fantastic arms of later
growth, we came to the upper terrace, which was paved in curious
patterns of stars and arabesques, with stones alternately round and
flat. Here a good-humored, cleanly peasant woman came clattering
out in her <i>sabots</i> from a side-door, key in hand, preceded us
up the double flight of steps, unlocked the great door, and
admitted us.</p>
<p>The interior, like the front, had been modernized about a
hundred and fifty years before, and resembled a little formal
Versailles or miniature Fontainebleau. Dismantled halls paved with
white marble; panelled ante-chambers an inch deep in dust; dismal
<i>salons</i> adorned with Renaissance arabesques and huge
looking-glasses, cracked and mildewed, and mended with pasted seams
of blue paper; boudoirs with faded Watteau panellings; corridors
with painted ceilings where mythological divinities, marvellously
foreshortened on a sky-blue ground, were seen surrounded by
rose-colored Cupids and garlanded with ribbons and flowers;
innumerable bed-rooms, some containing grim catafalques of beds
with gilded cornices and funereal plumes, some empty, some full of
stored-up furniture fast going to decay--all these in endless
number we traversed, conducted by the good-tempered
<i>concierge</i>, whose heavy <i>sabots</i> awakened ghostly echoes
from floor to floor.</p>
<p>At length, through an ante-chamber lined with a double file of
grim old family portraits--some so blackened with age and dust as
to be totally indistinguishable, and others bulging hideously out
of their frames--we came to the library, a really noble room,
lofty, panelled with walnut wood, floored with polished oak, and
looking over a wide expanse of level country. Long ranges of empty
book-shelves fenced in with broken wire-work ran round the walls.
The painted ceiling represented, as usual, the heavens and some
pagan divinities. A dumb old time-piece, originally constructed to
tell the months, the days of the year, and the hours, stood on a
massive corner bracket near the door. Long antique mirrors in heavy
black frames reached from floor to ceiling between each of the
windows; and in the centre of the room, piled all together and
festooned with a thick drapery of cobwebs, stood a dozen or so of
old carved chairs, screens, and foot-stools, rich with velvet,
brocade, and gilded leather, but now looking as if a touch would
crumble them to dust. Over the great carved fireplace, however,
hung a painting upon which my attention became riveted as soon as I
entered the room--a painting yellow with age; covered with those
minute cracks which are like wrinkles on the face of antique art,
coated with dust, and yet so singularly attractive that, having
once noticed it, I looked at nothing else.</p>
<p>It was the half-length portrait of a young lady in the costume
of the reign of Louis XVI. One hand rested on a stone urn; the
other was raised to her bosom, holding a thin blue scarf that
seemed to flutter in the wind. Her dress was of white satin, cut
low and square, with a stomacher of lace and pearls. She also wore
pearls in her hair, on her white arms, and on her whiter neck. Thus
much for the mere adjuncts; as for the face--ah, how can I ever
describe that pale, perfect, tender face, with its waving brown
hair and soft brown eyes, and that steadfast perpetual smile that
seemed to light the eyes from within, and to dwell in the corners
of the lips without parting or moving them? It was like a face seen
in a dream, or the imperfect image which seems to come between us
and the page when we read of Imogen asleep.</p>
<p>"Who was this lady?" I asked, eagerly.</p>
<p>The <i>concierge</i> nodded and rubbed her hands.</p>
<p>"Aha! M'sieur," said she, "'tis the best painting in the
chateau, as folks tell me. M'sieur is a connoisseur."</p>
<p>"But do you know whose portrait it is?"</p>
<p>"To be sure I do, M'sieur. It's the portrait of the last
Marquise--the one who was guillotined, poor soul, with her husband,
in--let me see--in 1793!"</p>
<p>"What an exquisite creature! Look, Josephine, did you ever see
anything so beautiful?"</p>
<p>"Beautiful!" repeated the grisette, with a sidelong glance at
one of the mirrors. "Beautiful, with such a coiffure and such a
bodice! <i>Ciel!</i> how tastes differ!"</p>
<p>"But her face, Josephine!"</p>
<p>"What of her face? I'm sure it's plain enough."</p>
<p>"Plain! Good heavens! what..."</p>
<p>But it was not worth while to argue upon it. I pulled out one of
the old chairs, and so climbed near enough to dust the surface of
the painting with my handkerchief.</p>
<p>"I wish I could buy it!" I exclaimed.</p>
<p>Josephine burst into a loud laugh.</p>
<p>"<i>Grand Dieu</i>!" said she, half pettishly, "if you are so
much in love with it as all that, I dare say it would not be
difficult!"</p>
<p>The <i>concierge</i> shook her head.</p>
<p>"Everything on this estate is locked up," said she. "Nothing can
be sold, nothing given away, nothing even repaired, till the
<i>proc&egrave;s</i> is ended."</p>
<p>I sighed, and came down reluctantly from my perch. Josephine was
visibly impatient. She had seen the wedding-party going down one of
the walks at the back of the house; and the <i>concierge</i> was
waiting to let us out. I drew her aside, and slipped a liberal
gratuity into her hand.</p>
<p>"If I were to come down here some day with a friend of mine who
is a painter," I whispered, "would you have any objection, Madame,
to allow him to make a little sketch of that portrait?"</p>
<p>The <i>concierge</i> looked into her palm, and seeing the value
of the coin, smiled, hesitated, put her finger to her lip, and
said:--</p>
<p>"<i>Ma foi</i>, M'sieur, I believe I have no business to allow
it; but--to oblige a gentleman like you--if there was nobody
about--"</p>
<p>I nodded. We understood each other sufficiently, and no more was
needed.</p>
<p>Once out of the house, Medemoiselle Josephine pouted, and took
upon herself to be sulky--a disposition which was by no means
lessened when, after traversing the park in various directions in
search of the bridal company, we found that they had gone out long
ago by a gate at the other side of the estate, and were by this
time piping, most probably, in the adjoining parish.</p>
<p>It was now five o'clock; so we hastened back through the
village, cast a last glance at the grim old tower on its steep
solitude, consigned ourselves to the yellow omnibus, and in due
time were once more flying along the iron road towards Paris. The
rapid motion, the dignity of occupying a first-class seat, and,
above all, the prospects of an excellent dinner, soon brought my
fair companion round again, and by the time we reached the Moulin
Rouge, she was all vivacity and good temper. The less I say about
that dinner the better. I am humiliated when I recall all that I
suffered, and all that she did. I blush even now when I remember
how she blew upon her soup, put her knife in her mouth, and picked
her teeth with her shawl-pin. What possessed her that she would
persist in calling the waiter "Monsieur?" And why, in Heaven's
name, need she have clapped her hands when I ordered the champagne?
To say that I had no appetite--that I wished myself at the
antipodes--that I longed to sink into my boots, to smother the
waiter, or to do anything equally desperate and unreasonable, is to
express but a tithe of the anguish I endured. I bore it, however,
in silence, little dreaming what a much heavier trial was yet in
store for me.</p>

<h3>I FALL A SACRIFICE TO MRS. GRUNDY.</h3>
<br>
<p>"A word with you, if you please, Basil Arbuthnot," said Dr.
Ch&eacute;ron, "when you have finished copying those
prescriptions."</p>
<p>Dr. Ch&eacute;ron was standing with his feet firmly planted in
the tiger-skin rug and his back to the fireplace. I was busy
writing at the study table, and glancing anxiously from time to
time at the skeleton clock upon the chimney-piece; for it was
getting on fast towards five, and at half-past six I was to take
Josephine to the Op&eacute;ra Comique. As perverse fortune would
have it, the Doctor had this afternoon given me more desk-work than
usual, and I began to doubt whether I should be able to dine,
dress, and reach the theatre in time if he detained me much
longer.</p>
<p>"But you need be in no haste," he added, looking at his watch.
"That is to say, upon my account."</p>
<p>I bowed nervously--I was always nervous in his presence--and
tried to write faster than ever; but, feeling his cold blue eye
upon me, made a blot, smeared it with my sleeve, left one word out,
wrote another twice over, and was continually tripped up by my pen,
which sputtered hideously and covered the page with florid passages
in little round spots, which only needed tails to become crotchets
and quavers. At length, just as the clock struck the hour, I
finished my task and laid aside my pen.</p>
<p>Dr. Ch&eacute;ron coughed preparatorily.</p>
<p>"It is some time," said he, "since you have given me any news of
your father. Do you often hear from him?"</p>
<p>"Not very often, sir," I replied. "About once in every three
weeks. He dislikes letter-writing."</p>
<p>Dr. Ch&eacute;ron took a packet of papers from his
breast-pocket, and ruffling them over, said, somewhat
indifferently:--</p>
<p>"Very true--very true. His notes are brief and few; but always
to the purpose. I heard from him this morning."</p>
<p>"Indeed, sir?"</p>
<p>"Yes--here is his letter. It encloses a remittance of
seventy-five pounds; fifty of which are for you. The remaining
twenty-five being reserved for the defrayal of your expenses at the
Ecole de M&eacute;decine and the Ecole Pratique."</p>
<p>I was delighted.</p>
<p>"Both are made payable through my banker," continued Dr.
Ch&eacute;ron, "and I am to take charge of your share till you
require it; which cannot be just yet, as I understand from this
letter that your father supplied you with the sum of one hundred
and five pounds on leaving England."</p>
<p>My delight went down to zero.</p>
<p>"Does my father say that I am not to have it now, sir?" I asked,
hesitatingly.</p>
<p>"He says, as I have already told you, that it is to be yours
when you require it."</p>
<p>"And if I require it very shortly, sir--in fact, if I require it
now?"</p>
<p>"You ought not to require it now," replied the Doctor, with a
cold, scrutinizing stare. "You ought not to have spent one hundred
and five pounds in five months."</p>
<p>I looked down in silence. I had more than spent it long since;
and I had to thank Madame de Marignan for the facility with which
it had flown. It was not to be denied that my course of lessons in
practical politeness had been somewhat expensive.</p>
<p>"How have you spent it?" asked Dr. Ch&eacute;ron, never removing
his eyes from my face.</p>
<p>I might have answered, in bouquets, opera stalls, and riding
horses; in dress coats, tight boots, and white kid gloves; in new
books, new music, bon-bons, cabs, perfumery, and the like
inexcusable follies. But I held my tongue instead, and said
nothing.</p>
<p>Dr. Ch&eacute;ron looked again at his watch.</p>
<p>"Have you kept any entries of your expenses since you came to
Paris?" said he.</p>
<p>"Not with--with any regularity, sir," I replied.</p>
<p>He took out his pencil-case and pocket-book.</p>
<p>"Let us try, then," said he, "to make an average calculation of
what they might be in five months."</p>
<p>I began to feel very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>"I believe your father paid your travelling expenses?"</p>
<p>I bowed affirmatively.</p>
<p>"Leaving you the clear sum of one hundred and five pounds." I
bowed again.</p>
<p>"Allowing, then, for your rent--which is, I believe, twenty
francs per week," said he, entering the figures as he went on,
"there will be four hundred francs spent in five months. For your
living, say thirty francs per week, which makes six hundred. For
your clothing, seventy-five per month, which makes three hundred
and seventy-five, and ought to be quite enough for a young man of
moderate tastes. For your washing and firewood, perhaps forty per
month, which makes two hundred--and for your incidental expenses,
say fifteen per week, which makes three hundred. We thus arrive at
a total of one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five francs,
which, reduced to English money at the average standard of
twenty-five francs to the sovereign, represents the exact sum of
seventy-five pounds. Do I make myself understood?"</p>
<p>I bowed for the third time.</p>
<p>"Of the original one hundred and five pounds, we now have thirty
not accounted for. May I ask how much of that surplus you have
left?"</p>
<p>"About--not more than--than a hundred and twenty francs," I
replied, stripping the feathers off all the pens in succession,
without knowing it.</p>
<p>"Have you any debts?"</p>
<p>"A--a few."</p>
<p>"Tailors' bills?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"What others?"</p>
<p>"A--a couple of months' rent, I believe, sir."</p>
<p>"Is that all?"</p>
<p>"N--not quite."</p>
<p>Dr. Ch&eacute;ron frowned, and looked again at his watch.</p>
<p>"Be good enough, Mr. Arbuthnot," he said, "to spare me this
amount of useless interrogation by at once stating the nature and
amount of the rest."</p>
<p>"I--I cannot positively state the amount, sir," I said, absurdly
trying to get the paper-weight into my waistcoat pocket, and then
putting it down in great confusion. "I--I have an account at
Monceau's in the Rue Duphot, and..."</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon," interrupted Dr. Ch&eacute;ron: "but who is
Monceau?"</p>
<p>"Monceau's--Monceau's livery-stables, sir."</p>
<p>Dr. Ch&eacute;ron slightly raised his eye-brows, and entered the
name.</p>
<p>"And at Lavoisier's, on the Boulevard Poissonni&egrave;re--"</p>
<p>"What is sold, pray, at Lavoisier's?"</p>
<p>"Gloves, perfumes, hosiery, ready-made linen..."</p>
<p>"Enough--you can proceed."</p>
<p>"I have also a bill at--at Barbet's, in the Passage de
l'Op&eacute;ra."</p>
<p>"And Barbet is--?"</p>
<p>"A--a florist!" I replied, very reluctantly.</p>
<p>"Humph!--a florist!" observed Dr. Ch&eacute;ron, again
transfixing me with the cold, blue eye. "To what amount do you
suppose you are indebted to Monsieur Barbet?"</p>
<p>I looked down, and became utterly unintelligible.</p>
<p>"Fifty francs?"</p>
<p>"I--I fear, more than--than--"</p>
<p>"A hundred? A hundred and fifty? Two hundred?"</p>
<p>"About two hundred, I suppose, sir," I said desperately.</p>
<p>"Two hundred francs--that is to say, eight pounds English--to
your florist! Really, Mr. Arbuthnot, you must be singularly fond of
flowers!"</p>
<p>I looked down in silence.</p>
<p>"Have you a conservatory attached to your rooms?"</p>
<p>The skeleton clock struck the half hour.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, sir," I said, driven now to the last extremity,
"but--but I have an engagement which--in short, I will, if you
please, make out a list of--of these items, ascertaining the
correct amount of each; and when once paid, I will endeavor--I
mean, it is my earnest desire, to--to limit my expenditure strictly
to--in short, to study economy for the future. If, in the meantime,
you will have the goodness to excuse me...."</p>
<p>"One word, young man. Will the fifty pounds cover your
debts?"</p>
<p>"Quite, sir, I am confident."</p>
<p>"And leave you something in hand for your current expenses?"</p>
<p>"Indeed, I fear very little."</p>
<p>"In that case what will you do?"</p>
<p>This was a terrible question, and one for which I could find no
answer.</p>
<p>"Write to your father for another remittance--eh?"</p>
<p>"I--upon my word, I dare not, sir," I faltered.</p>
<p>"Then you would go in debt again?"</p>
<p>"I really fear--even with the strictest economy--I--"</p>
<p>"Be so obliging as to let me have your seat," said Dr.
Ch&eacute;ron, thrusting the obnoxious note-book into his pocket
and taking my place at the desk, from which he brought out a couple
of cards, and a printed paper.</p>
<p>"This ticket," said he, "admits the holder to the anatomical
course for the term now beginning, and this to the lectures at the
Ecole Pratique. Both are in my gift. The first is worth two hundred
francs, and the second two hundred and fifty. I ought, perhaps, in
strict justice, to bestow them upon some needy and deserving
individual: however, to save you from debt, or a very unpleasant
alternative, I will fill them in with your name, and, when you
bring me all your bills receipted, I will transfer to your account
the four hundred and fifty francs which I must, otherwise, have
paid for your courses out of the remittance forwarded by your
father for that purpose. Understand, however, that I must first
have the receipts, and that I expect you, on the word of a
gentleman, to commit no more follies, and to contract no more
debts."</p>
<p>"Oh, sir!" I exclaimed, "how can I ever--"</p>
<p>"No thanks, I beg," interposed Dr. Ch&eacute;ron. "Prove your
gratitude by your conduct; do not trouble yourself to talk about
it."</p>
<p>"Indeed, sir, you may depend--"</p>
<p>"And no promises either, if you please. I attach no kind of
value to them. Stay--here is my check for the fifty pounds
forwarded by your father. With that sum extricate yourself from
debt. You know the rest."</p>
<p>Hereupon Dr. Ch&eacute;ron replaced the cards and the printed
form, double-locked his desk, and, with a slight gesture of the
hand, frigidly dismissed me.</p>
<p>I left the house quite chopfallen. I was relieved, it is true,
from the incubus of debt; but then how small a figure I had cut in
the eyes of Dr. Ch&eacute;ron! Besides, I was small for the second
time--reproved for the second time--lectured, helped, put down, and
poohpoohed, for the second time! Could I have peeped at myself just
then through the wrong end of a telescope, I vow I could not have
looked smaller in my own eyes.</p>
<p>I had no time to dine; so I despatched a cup of coffee and a
roll on my way home, and went hungry to the theatre.</p>
<p>Josephine was got up with immense splendor for this occasion;
greatly to her own satisfaction and my disappointment. Having hired
a small private box in the least conspicuous part of the theatre, I
had committed the cowardly mistake of endeavoring to transform my
grisette into a woman of fashion. I had bought her a pink and white
opera cloak, a pretty little fan, a pair of white kid gloves, and a
bouquet. With these she wore a decent white muslin dress furnished
out of the limited resources of her own wardrobe, and a wreath of
pink roses, the work of her own clever fingers. Thus equipped, she
was far less pretty than in her coquettish little every-day cap,
and looked, I regret to say, more like an <i>ouvri&egrave;re</i>
than ever. Aggravating above all else, however, was her own
undisguised delight in her appearance.</p>
<p>"Are my flowers all right? Is my dress tumbled? Is the hood of
my cloak in the middle of my back?" were the questions she
addressed to me every moment. In the ante-room she took advantage
of each mirror we passed. In the lobby I caught her trying to look
at her own back. When we reached our box she pulled her chair to
the very centre of it, and sat there as if she expected to be
admired by the whole audience.</p>
<p>"My dear Josephine," I remonstrated, "sit back here, facing the
stage. You will see much better--besides, it is your proper seat,
being the only lady in the box."</p>
<p>"Ah, <i>mon Dieu!</i> then I cannot see the house--and how
pretty it is! Ever so much prettier than the Gai&eacute;t&eacute;,
or the Porte St. Martin!"</p>
<p>"You can see the house by peeping behind the curtain."</p>
<p>"As if I were ashamed to be seen! <i>Par exemple</i>!"</p>
<p>"Nay, as you please. I only advise you according to custom and
fashion."</p>
<p>Josephine pouted, and unwillingly conceded a couple of
inches.</p>
<p>"I wish I had brought the little telescope you gave me last
Sunday," said she, presently. "There is a gentleman with one down
there in the stalls."</p>
<p>"A telescope at the opera--the gods forbid! Here, however, is my
opera-glass, if you like to use it."</p>
<p>Josephine turned it over curiously, and peeped first through one
tube and then through the other.</p>
<p>"Which ought I to look through?" asked she.</p>
<p>"Both, of course."</p>
<p>"Both! How can I?"</p>
<p>"Why thus--as you look through a pair of spectacles."</p>
<p>"<i>Ciel!</i> I can't manage that! I can never look through
anything without covering up one eye with my hand."</p>
<p>"Then I think you had better be contented with your own charming
eyes, <i>ma belle</i>" said I, nervously. "How do you like your
bouquet?"</p>
<p>Josephine sniffed at it as if she were taking snuff, and
pronounced it perfect. Just then the opera began. I withdrew into
the shade, and Josephine was silenced for a while in admiration of
the scenery and the dresses. By and by, she began to yawn.</p>
<p>"Ah, <i>mon Dieu!</i>" said she, "when will they have done
singing? I have not heard a word all this time."</p>
<p>"But everything is sung, <i>ma ch&eacute;re</i>, in an
opera."</p>
<p>"What do you mean? Is there no play?"</p>
<p>"This is the play; only instead of speaking their words, they
sing them."</p>
<p>Josephine shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>"Ah, bah!" said she. "How stupid! I had rather have seen the
<i>Closerie des G&ecirc;nets</i> at the Grai&eacute;t&eacute;, if
that is to be the case the whole evening. Oh, dear! there is such a
pretty lady come into the opposite box, in such a beautiful blue
<i>glac&eacute;</i>, trimmed with black velvet and lace!"</p>
<p>"Hush! you must not talk while they are singing!"</p>
<p>"<i>Tiens!</i> it is no pleasure to come out and be dumb. But do
just see the lady in the opposite box! She looks exactly as if she
had walked out of a fashion-book."</p>
<p>"My dear child, I don't care one pin to look at her," said I,
preferring to keep as much out of sight as possible. "To admire
your pretty face is enough for me."</p>
<p>Josephine squeezed my hand affectionately.</p>
<p>"That is just as Emile used to talk to me," said she.</p>
<p>I felt by no means flattered.</p>
<p>"<i>Regardez done!</i>" said she, pulling me by the sleeve, just
as I was standing up, a little behind her chair, looking at the
stage. "That lady in the blue <i>glac&eacute;</i> never takes her
eyes from our box! She points us out to the gentleman who is with
her--do look!"</p>
<p>I turned my glass in the direction to which she pointed, and
recognised Madame de Marignan!</p>
<p>I turned hot and cold, red and white, all in one moment, and
shrank back like a snail that has been touched, or a sea-anemone at
the first dig of the naturalist.</p>
<p>"Does she know you?" asked Josephine.</p>
<p>"I--I--probably--that is to say--I have met her in society."</p>
<p>"And who is the gentleman?"</p>
<p>That was just what I was wondering. It was not Delaroche. It was
no one whom I had ever seen before. It was a short, fat, pale man,
with a bald head, and a ribbon in his button-hole.</p>
<p>"Is he her husband?" pursued Josephine.</p>
<p>The suggestion flashed upon me like a revelation. Had I not
heard that M. de Marignan was coming home from Algiers? Of course
it was he. No doubt of it. A little vulgar, fat, bald man....
Pshaw, just the sort of a husband that she deserved!</p>
<p>"How she looks at me!" said Josephine.</p>
<p>I felt myself blush, so to speak, from head to foot.</p>
<p>"Good Heavens! my dear girl," I exclaimed, "take your elbows off
the front of the box!"</p>
<p>Josephine complied, with a pettish little grimace.</p>
<p>"And, for mercy's sake, don't hold your head as if you feared it
would tumble off!"</p>
<p>"It is the flowers," said she. "They tickle the back of my neck,
whenever I move my head. I am much more comfortable in my cap."</p>
<p>"Never mind. Make the best of it, and listen to this song."</p>
<p>It was the great tenor ballad of the evening. The house was
profoundly silent; the first wandering chords of a harp were heard
behind the scenes; and Duprez began. In the very midst of one of
his finest and tenderest <i>sostenuto</i> passages, Josephine
sneezed--and such a sneeze! you might have heard it out in the
lobbies. An audible titter ran round the house. I saw Madame de
Marignan cover her face with her handkerchief, and yield to an
irrepressible fit of laughter. As for the tenor, he cast a
withering glance up at the box, and made a marked pause before
resuming his song. Merciful powers! what crime had I committed that
I should be visited with such a punishment as this?</p>
<p>"Wretched girl!" I exclaimed, savagely, "what have you
done?"</p>
<p>"Done, <i>mon ami!</i>" said Josephine, innocently. "Why, I fear
I have taken cold."</p>
<p>I groaned aloud.</p>
<p>"Taken cold!" I muttered to myself. "Would to Heaven you had
taken prussic acid!"</p>
<p>"<i>Qu'est ce que c'est?"</i> asked she.</p>
<p>But it was not worth while to reply. I gave myself up to my
fate. I determined to remonstrate no more. I flung myself on a seat
at the back of the box, and made up my mind to bear all that might
yet be in store for me. When she openly ate a stick of <i>sucre
d'orge</i> after this, I said nothing. When she applauded with both
hands, I endured in silence. At length the performance came to a
close and the curtain fell. Madame de Marignan had left before the
last act, so I ran no danger of encountering her on the way out;
but I was profoundly miserable, nevertheless. As for Josephine,
she, poor child, had not enjoyed her evening at all, and was
naturally out of temper. We quarrelled tremendously in the cab, and
parted without having made it up. It was all my own fault. How
could I be such a fool as to suppose that, with a few shreds and
patches of finery, I could make a fine lady of a grisette?</p>

<h3>HIGH ART IN THE QUARTIER LATIN.</h3>
<br>
<p>"But, my dear fellow, what else could you have expected? You
took Mam'selle Josephine to the <i>Opera Comique. Eh bien!</i> you
might as well have taken an oyster up Mount Vesuvius. Our fair
friend was out of her element. <i>Voil&agrave; tout</i>."</p>
<p>"Confound her and her element!" I exclaimed with a groan. "What
the deuce <i>is</i> her element--the Quartier Latin?"</p>
<p>"The Quartier Latin is to some extent her habitat--but then
Mam'selle Josephine belongs to a genus of which you, <i>cher</i>
Monsieur Arbuthnot, are deplorably ignorant--the genus grisette.
The grisette from a certain point of view is the
<i>chef-d'oeuvre</i> of Parisian industry; the bouquet of Parisian
civilization. She is indigenous to the <i>mansarde</i> and the
<i>pav&eacute;</i>--bears no transplantation--flourishes in <i>the
premi&egrave;re balconie</i>, the suburban <i>guingette</i>, and
the Salle Valentinois; but degenerates at a higher elevation. To
improve her is to spoil her. In her white cap and muslin gown, the
Parisian grisette is simply delicious. In a smart bonnet, a
Cashmere and a brougham, she is simply detestable. Fine clothes
vulgarize her. Fine surroundings demoralize her. Lodged on the
sixth story, rich in the possession of a cuckoo-clock, a canary,
half a dozen pots of mignonette, and some bits of cheap furniture
in imitation mahogany, she has every virtue and every fault that is
charming in woman--childlike gaiety; coquetry; thoughtless
generosity; the readiest laugh, the readiest tear, and the warmest
heart in the world. Transplant her to the Chauss&eacute;e d'Antin,
instil the taste for diamonds, truffles, and Veuve Clicquot, and
you poison her whole nature. She becomes false, cruel, greedy,
prodigal of your money, parsimonious of her own--a vampire--a
ghoul--the hideous thing we call in polite parlance a <i>Fille de
Marbre."</i></p>
<p>Thus, with much gravity and emphasis, spoke Herr Franz
M&uuml;ller, lying on his back upon a very ricketty sofa, and
smoking like a steam-engine. A cup of half-cold coffee, and a
bottle of rum three parts emptied stood beside him on the floor.
These were the remains of his breakfast; for it was yet early in
the morning of the day following my great misadventure at the
Op&eacute;ra Comique, and I had sought him out at his lodgings in
the Rue Clovis at an hour when the Quartier Latin was for the most
part in bed.</p>
<p>"Josephine, at all events, is not of the stuff that <i>Filles de
Marbre</i> are made of," I said, smiling.</p>
<p>"Perhaps not--<i>mais, que voulez-vous?</i> We are what we are.
A grisette makes a bad fine lady. A fine lady would make a still
worse grisette. The Archbishopric of Paris is a most repectable and
desirable preferment; but your humble servant, for instance, would
hardly suit the place,"</p>
<p>"And the moral of this learned and perspicuous discourse?"</p>
<p>"<i>Tiens</i>! the moral, is--keep our fair friend in her place.
Remember that a dinner at thirty sous in the Palais Royal, or a
f&ecirc;te with fireworks at Mabille, will give her ten times more
pleasure than the daintiest repast you could order at the Maison
Dor&eacute;e, or the choicest night of the season at either opera
house. And how should it be otherwise? One must understand a thing
to be able to enjoy it; and I'll be sworn Mam'selle Josephine was
infinitely more bored last night than yourself."</p>
<p>Our conversation, or rather his monologue, was here interrupted
by the ringing of the outer bell.</p>
<p>The artist sat up, took his pipe from his lips, and looked
considerably disturbed.</p>
<p>"<i>Mille tonnerres</i>!" said he in a low tone. "Who can it
be?... so early in the day ... not yet ten o'clock ... it is very
mysterious."</p>
<p>"It is only mysterious," said I, "as long as you don't open the
door. Shall I answer the bell?"</p>
<p>"No--yes--wait a moment ... suppose it is that demon, my
landlord, or that archfiend, my tailor--then you must say ... holy
St. Nicholas! you must say I am in bed with small-pox, or that I've
broken out suddenly into homicidal delirium, and you're my
keeper."</p>
<p>"Unfortunately I should not know either of your princes of
darkness at first sight."</p>
<p>"True--and it might be Dupont, who owes me thirty francs, and
swore by the bones of his aunt (an excellent person, who keeps an
estaminet in the Place St. Sulpice) that he would pay me this week.
<i>Diable</i>! there goes the bell again."</p>
<p>"It would perhaps be safest," I suggested, "to let M. or N. ring
on till he is tired of the exercise."</p>
<p>"But conceive the horrid possibility of letting thirty francs
ring themselves out of patience! No, <i>mon ami</i>--I will dare
the worst that may happen. Wait here for me--I will answer the door
myself,"</p>
<p>Now it should be explained that M&uuml;ller's apartments
consisted of three rooms. First, a small outer chamber which he
dignified with the title of Salle d'Attente, but which, as it was
mainly furnished with old boots, umbrellas and walking-sticks, and
contained, by way of accommodation for visitors only a three-legged
stool and a door-mat, would have been more fitly designated as the
hall. Between this Salle d'Attente and the den in which he slept,
ate, smoked, and received his friends, lay the studio--once a
stately salon, now a wilderness of litter and dilapidation. On one
side you beheld three windows closely boarded up, with strips of
newspaper pasted over the cracks to exclude every gleam of day.
Overhead yawned a huge, dusty skylight, to make way for which a
fine old painted ceiling had been ruthlessly knocked away. On the
walls were pinned and pasted all sorts of rough sketches and
studies in color and crayon. In one corner lolled a
despondent-looking lay-figure in a moth-eaten Spanish cloak; in
another lay a heap of plaster-casts, gigantic hands and feet,
broken-nosed masks of the Apollo, the Laocoon, the Hercules
Farnese, and other foreigners of distinction. Upon the
chimney-piece were displayed a pair of foils, a lute, a skull, an
antique German drinking-mug, and several very modern empty bottles.
In the middle of the room stood two large easels, a divan, a round
table, and three or four chairs; while the floor was thickly strewn
with empty color-tubes, bits of painting-rag, corks, cigar-ends,
and all kinds of miscellaneous litter.</p>
<p>All these things I had observed as I passed in; for this, be it
remembered, was my first visit to M&uuml;ller in his own
territory.</p>
<p>I heard him go through the studio and close the door behind him,
and then I heard him open the door upon the public staircase.
Presently he came back, shutting the door behind him as before.</p>
<p>"My dear fellow," he exclaimed, breathlessly, "you have brought
luck with you! What do you think? A sitter--positively, a sitter!
Wants to be sketched in at once--<i>Vive la France</i>!"</p>
<p>"Man or woman? Young or old? Plain or pretty?"</p>
<p>"Elderly half-length, feminine gender--Madame Tapotte. They are
both there, Monsieur and Madame Excellent couple--redolent of the
country--husband bucolic, adipose, auriferous--wife arrayed in all
her glory, like the Queen of Sheba. I left them in the Salle
d'Attente--told them I had a sitter--time immensely
occupied--half-lengths furiously in demand ... <i>Will</i> you
oblige me by performing the part for a few minutes, just to carry
out the idea?"</p>
<p>"What part?"</p>
<p>"The part of sitter."</p>
<p>"Oh, with pleasure," I replied, laughing. "Do with me what you
please,"</p>
<p>"You don't mind? Come! you are the best fellow in the world.
Now, if you'll sit in that arm-chair facing the light--head a
little thrown back, arms folded, chin up ... Capital! You don't
know what an effect this will have upon the provincial mind!"</p>
<p>"But you're not going to let them in! You have no portrait of me
to be at work upon!"</p>
<p>"My dear fellow, I've dozens of half-finished studies, any one
of which will answer the purpose. <i>Voil&agrave;</i>! here is the
very thing."</p>
<p>And snatching up a canvas that had been standing till now with
its face to the wall, he flourished it triumphantly before my eyes,
and placed it on the easel.</p>
<p>"Heavens and earth!" I exclaimed, "that's a copy of the Titian
in the Louvre--the 'Young Man with the Glove!'"</p>
<p>"What of that? Our Tapottes will never find out the difference.
By the way, I told them you were a great English Milord, so please
keep up the character."</p>
<p>"I will try to do credit to the peerage."</p>
<p>"And if you would not mind throwing in a word of English every
now and then ... a little Goddam, for instance.. . Eh?"</p>
<p>I laughed and shook my head.</p>
<p>"I will pose for you as Milord with all the pleasure in life," I
said; "only I cannot undertake to pose for the traditional Milord
of the Bouffes Parisiens! However, I will speak some English, and,
if you like, I'll know no French."</p>
<p>"No, no--<i>diable</i>! you must know a little, or I can't
exchange a word with you. But very little--the less the better. And
now I'll let them in."</p>
<p>They came; Madame first--tall, buxom, large-featured,
fresh-colored, radiant in flowers, lace, and Palais Royal jewelry;
then Monsieur--short, fat, bald, rosy and smiling, with a huge
frill to his shirt-front and a nankeen waistcoat.</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller introduced them with much ceremony and many
apologies.</p>
<p>"Permit me, milord," he said, "to present Monsieur and Madame
Tapotte--Monsieur and Madame Tapotte; Milord Smithfield."</p>
<p>I rose and bowed with the gravity becoming my rank.</p>
<p>"I have explained to milord," continued M&uuml;ller, addressing
himself partly to the new-comers, partly to me, and chiefly to the
study on the easel, "that having no second room in which to invite
Monsieur and Madame to repose themselves, I am compelled to ask
them into the studio--where, however, his lordship is so very kind
as to say that they are welcome." (Hereupon Madame Tapotte curtsied
again, and Monsieur ducked his bald head, and I returned their
salutations with the same dignity as before.) "If Monsieur and
Madame will be pleased to take seats, however, his lordship's
sitting will be ended in about ten minutes. <i>Mille pardons</i>,
the face, milord, a little more to the right. Thank you--thank you
very much. And if you will do me the favor to look at me ... for
the expression of the eye--just so--thank you! A most important
point, milord, is the expression of the eye. When I say the
expression, I mean the fire, the sparkle, the liquidity ...
<i>enfin</i> the expression!"</p>
<p>Here he affected to put in some touches with immense
delicacy--then retreated a couple of yards, the better to
contemplate his work--pursed up his mouth--ran his fingers through
his hair--shaded his eyes with his hand--went back and put in
another touch--again retreated--again put in a touch; and so on
some three or four times successively.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Monsieur and Madame Tapotte were fidgeting upon their
chairs in respectful silence. Every now and then they exchanged
glances of wonder and admiration. They were evidently dying to
compare my august features with my portrait, but dared not take the
liberty of rising. At length the lady's curiosity could hold out no
longer.</p>
<p>"<i>Ah, mon Dieu</i>!" she said; "but it must be very fatiguing
to sit so long in the same position. And to paint.... <i>Oiel!</i>
what practice! what perseverance! what patience! <i>Avec
permission</i>, M'sieur..."</p>
<p>And with this she sidled up to M&uuml;ller's elbow, leaving
Monsieur Tapotte thunderstruck at her audacity.</p>
<p>Then for a moment she stood silent; but during that moment the
eager, apologetic smile vanished suddenly out of her face, and was
succeeded by an expression of blank disappointment.</p>
<p>"<i>Tiens</i>!" she said bluntly. "I don't see one bit of
likeness."</p>
<p>I turned hot from head to foot, but M&uuml;ller's serene
effrontery was equal to the occasion.</p>
<p>"I dare say not, Madame," he replied, coolly. "I dare say not.
This portrait is not intended to be like."</p>
<p>Madame Tapotte's eyes and mouth opened simultaneously.</p>
<p>"<i>Comment</i>!" she exclaimed.</p>
<p>"I should be extremely sorry," continued M&uuml;ller, loftily,
"and his lordship would be extremely sorry, if there were too much
resemblance."</p>
<p>"But a--a likeness--it seems to me, should at all events
be--like," stammered Madame Tapotte, utterly bewildered.</p>
<p>"And if M'sieur is to paint my wife," added Monsieur Tapotte,
who had by this time joined the group at the easel,
"I--I...<i>Dame</i>! it must be a good deal more like than
this."</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller drew himself up with an air of great dignity.</p>
<p>"Sir," he said, "if Madame does me the honor to sit to me for
her portrait--for her <i>own</i> portrait, observe--I flatter
myself the resemblance will be overwhelming. But you must permit me
to inform you that Milord Smithfield is not sitting for his own
portrait."</p>
<p>The Tapottes looked at each other in a state bordering on
stupefaction.</p>
<p>"His lordship," continued M&uuml;ller, "is sitting for the
portrait of one of his illustrious ancestors--a nobleman of the
period of Queen Elizabeth."</p>
<p>Tapotte <i>mari</i> scratched his head, and smiled feebly.</p>
<p>"<i>Parbleu</i>!" said he, "<i>mais c'est bien dr&ocirc;le,
&ccedil;a</i>!"</p>
<p>The artist shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>"It so happens," said he, "that his lordship's gallery at
Smithfield Castle has unhappily been more than half destroyed by
fire. Two centuries of family portraits reduced to ashes! Terrible
misfortune! Only one way of repairing the loss--that is of
partially repairing it. I do my best. I read the family records--I
study the history of the period--his lordship sits to me daily--I
endeavor to give a certain amount of family likeness; sometimes
more, you observe, sometimes less ... enormous responsibility,
Monsieur Tapotte!"</p>
<p>"Oh, enormous!"</p>
<p>"The taste for family portraits," continued M&uuml;ller, still
touching up the Titian, "is a very natural one--and is on the
increase. Many gentlemen of--of somewhat recent wealth, come to me
for their ancestors."</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>"<i>Foi d'honneur</i>. Few persons, however, are as
conscientious as his lordship in the matter of family resemblance.
They mostly buy up their forefathers ready-made--adopt them,
christen them, and ask no questions."</p>
<p>Monsieur and Madame Tapotte exchanged glances.</p>
<p>"<i>Tiens, mon ami</i>, why should we not have an ancestor or
two, as well as other folks," suggested the lady, in a very audible
whisper.</p>
<p>Monsieur shook his head, and muttered something about the
expense.</p>
<br>
<p>"There is no harm, at all events," urged madame, "in asking the
price."</p>
<p>"My charge for gallery portraits, madame, varies from sixty to a
hundred francs," said M&uuml;ller.</p>
<p>"Heavens! how dear! Why, my own portrait is to be only
fifty."</p>
<p>"Sixty, Madame, if we put in the hands and the jewelry," said
M&uuml;ller, blandly.</p>
<p>"<i>Eh bien</i>!--sixty. But for these other things.... bah!
<i>ils sont fierement chers</i>."</p>
<p>"<i>Pardon</i>, madame! The elegancies and superfluities of life
are, by a just rule of political economy, expensive. It is right
that they should be so; as it is right that the necessaries of life
should be within the reach of the poorest. Bread, for instance, is
strictly necessary, and should be cheap. A great-grandfather, on
the contrary, is an elegant superfluity, and may be put up at a
high figure."</p>
<p>"There is some truth in that," murmured Monsieur Tapotte.</p>
<p>"Besides, in the present instance, one also pays for
antiquity."</p>
<p>"<i>C'est juste--C'est juste</i>."</p>
<p>"At the same time," continued M&uuml;ller, "if Monsieur Tapotte
were to honor me with a commission for, say, half a dozen family
portraits, I would endeavor to put them in at forty francs
apiece--including, at that very low price, a Revolutionary Deputy,
a beauty of the Louis Quinze period, and a Marshal of France."</p>
<p>"<i>Tiens</i>! that's a fair offer enough," said madame. "What
say you, <i>mon ami</i>?"</p>
<p>But Monsieur Tapotte, being a cautious man, would say nothing
hastily. He coughed, looked doubtful, declined to commit himself to
an opinion, and presently drew off into a corner for the purpose of
holding a whispered consultation with his wife.</p>
<p>Meanwhile M&uuml;ller laid aside his brushes and palette,
informed me with a profound bow that my lordship had honored him by
sitting as long as was strictly necessary, and requested my opinion
upon the progress of the work.</p>
<p>I praised it rapturously. You would have thought, to hear me,
that for drawing, breadth, finish, color, composition, chiaroscuro,
and every other merit that a painting could possess, this
particular <i>chef-d'oeuvre</i> excelled all the masterpieces of
Europe.</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller bowed, and bowed, and bowed, like a Chinaman at a
visit of ceremony; He was more than proud; he was overwhelmed,
<i>accabl&eacute;</i>, et caetera, et caetera.</p>
<p>The Tapottes left off whispering, and listened breathlessly.</p>
<p>"He is evidently a great painter, <i>not' jeune homme</i>!" said
Madame in one of her large whispers.</p>
<p>To which Monsieur replied as audibly:--"<i>&Ccedil;a se voit, ma
femme--sacre nom d'une pipe</i>!"</p>
<p>"Milford will do me the favor to sit again on Friday?" said
M&uuml;ller, as I took up my hat and gloves.</p>
<p>I replied with infinite condescension that I would endeavor to
do so. I then made the stiffest of stiff bows to the excellent
Tapottes, and, ushered to the door by M&uuml;ller, took my
departure majestically in the character of Lord Smithfield.</p>

<h3>THE QUARTIER LATIN.</h3>
<br>
<p>The dear old Quartier Latin of my time--the Quartier Latin of
Balzac, of B&eacute;ranger, of Henry Murger---the Quartier Latin
where Franz M&uuml;ller had his studio; where Messieurs Gustave;
Jules, and Adrien gave their unparalleled <i>soir&eacute;es
dansantes</i>; where I first met my ex-flame Josephine--exists no
longer. It has been improved off the face of the earth, and with it
such a gay bizarre, improvident world of youth and folly as shall
never again be met together on the banks of the Seine.</p>
<p>Ah me! how well I remember that dingy, delightful Arcadia--the
Rue de la Vieille Boucherie, narrow, noisy, crowded, with
projecting upper stories and Gothic pent-house roofs--the Rue de la
Parcheminerie, unchanged since the Middle Ages--the Rue St.
Jacques, steep, interminable, dilapidated; with its dingy cabarets,
its brasseries, its cheap restaurants, its grimy shop windows
filled with colored prints, with cooked meats, with tobacco, old
books, and old clothes; its ancient colleges and hospitals,
time-worn and weather-beaten, frowning down upon the busy
thoroughfare and breaking the squalid line of shops; its grim old
hotels swarming with lodgers, floor above floor, from the cobblers
in the cellars to the grisettes in the attics! Then again, the
gloomy old Place St. Michel, its abundant fountain ever flowing,
ever surrounded by water-carts and water-carriers, by women with
pails, and bare-footed street urchins, and thirsty drovers drinking
out of iron cups chained to the wall. And then, too, the Rue de la
Harpe....</p>
<p>I close my eyes, and the strange, precipitous, picturesque,
decrepit old street, with its busy, surging crowd, its
street-cries, its street-music, and its indescribable union of
gloom and gayety, rises from its ashes. Here, grand old dilapidated
mansions with shattered stone-carvings, delicate wrought-iron
balconies all rust-eaten and broken, and windows in which every
other pane is cracked or patched, alternate with more modern but
still more ruinous houses, some leaning this way, some that, some
with bulging upper stories, some with doorways sunk below the level
of the pavement. Yonder, gloomy and grim, stands the College of
Saint Louis. Dark alleys open off here and there from the main
thoroughfare, and narrow side streets, steep as flights of steps.
Low sheds and open stalls cling, limpet-like, to every available
nook and corner. An endless procession of trucks, wagons,
water-carts, and fiacres rumbles perpetually by. Here people live
at their windows and in the doorways--the women talking from
balcony to balcony, the men smoking, reading, playing at dominoes.
Here too are more caf&eacute;s and cabarets, open-air stalls for
the sale of fried fish, and cheap restaurants for workmen and
students, where, for a sum equivalent to sevenpence half-penny
English, the Quartier Latin regales itself upon meats and drinks of
dark and enigmatical origin. Close at hand is the Place and College
of the Sorbonne--silent in the midst of noisy life, solitary in the
heart of the most crowded quarter of Paris. A sombre medi&aelig;val
gloom pervades that ancient quadrangle; scant tufts of sickly grass
grow here and there in the interstices of the pavement; the dust of
centuries crust those long rows of windows never opened. A little
further on is the Rue des Gr&egrave;s, narrow, crowded,
picturesque, one uninterrupted perspective of bookstalls and
bookshops from end to end. Here the bookseller occasionally pursues
a two-fold calling, and retails not only literature but a cellar of
<i>petit vin bleu</i>; and here, overnight, the thirsty student
exchanges for a bottle of Macon the "Code Civile" that he must
perforce buy back again at second-hand in the morning.</p>
<p>A little farther on, and we come to the College Saint Louis,
once the old College Narbonne; and yet a few yards more, and we are
at the doors of the Theatre du Pantheon, once upon a time the
Church of St. B&eacute;noit, where the stage occupies the site of
the altar, and an orchestra stall in what was once the nave, may be
had for seventy-five centimes. Here, too, might be seen the shop of
the immortal Lesage, renowned throughout the Quartier for the
manufacture of a certain kind of transcendental ham-patty,
peculiarly beloved by student and grisette; and here, clustering
within a stone's throw of each other, were to be found those famous
restaurants, Pompon, Viot, Flicoteaux, and the "Boeuf
Enrag&eacute;," where, on gala days, many an Alphonse and Fifine,
many a Th&eacute;ophile and Cerisette, were wont to hold high feast
and festival--terms sevenpence half-penny each, bread at
discretion, water gratis, wine and toothpicks extra.</p>
<p>But it was in the side streets, courts, and <i>impasses</i> that
branched off to the left and right of the main arteries, that one
came upon the very heart of the old Pays Latin; for the Rue St.
Jacques, the Rue de la Harpe, the Rue des Gr&egrave;s, narrow,
steep, dilapidated though they might be, were in truth the leading
thoroughfares--the Boulevards, so to speak--of the Student
Quartier. In most of the side alleys, however, some of which dated
back as far, and farther, than the fifteenth century, there was no
footway for passengers, and barely space for one wheeled vehicle at
a time. A filthy gutter invariably flowed down the middle of the
street. The pavement, as it peeped out here and there through a
<i>moraine</i> of superimposed mud and offal, was seen to consist
of small oblong stones, like petrified kidney potatoes. The houses,
some leaning this way, some that, with projecting upper stories and
overhanging gable-roofs, nodded together overhead, leaving but a
narrow strip of sky down which the sunlight strove in vain to
struggle. Long poles upon which were suspended old clothes hung out
to air, and ragged linen to dry, stood out like tattered banners
from the attic windows. Here, too, every ground-floor was a shop,
open, unglazed, cavernous, where the dealer lay <i>perdu</i> in the
gloom of midday, like a spider in the midst of his web, surrounded
by piles of old bottles, old iron, old clothes, old furniture, or
whatever else his stock in trade might consist of.</p>
<p>Of such streets--less like streets, indeed, than narrow,
overhanging gorges and ravines of damp and mouldering stone--of
such streets, I say, intricate, winding, ill-lighted, unventilated,
pervaded by an atmosphere compounded of the fumes of fried fish,
tobacco, old leather, mildew and dirt, there were hundreds in the
Quartier Latin of my time:--streets to the last degree unattractive
as places of human habitation, but rich, nevertheless, in historic
associations, in picturesque detail, and in archaeological
interest. Such a street, for instance, was the Rue du Fouarre
(scarcely a feature of which has been modernized to this day),
where Dante, when a student of theology in Paris, attended the
lectures of one Sigebert, a learned monk of Gemblours, who
discoursed to his scholars in the open air, they sitting round him
the while upon fresh straw strewn upon the pavement. Such a street
was the Rue des Cordiers, close adjoining the Rue des Gr&egrave;s,
where Rousseau lived and wrote; and the Rue du Dragon, where might
then be seen the house of Bernard Palissy; and the Rue des
Ma&ccedil;ons, where Racine lived; and the Rue des Marais, where
Adrienne Lecouvreur--poor, beautiful, generous, ill-fated Adrienne
Lecouvreur!--died. Here, too, in a blind alley opening off the Rue
St. Jacques, yet stands part of that Carmelite Convent in which,
for thirty years, Madame de la Valli&egrave;re expiated the
solitary frailty of her life. And so at every turn! Not a gloomy
by-street, not a dilapidated fountain, not a grim old college
fa&ccedil;ade but had its history, or its legend. Here the voice of
Abelard thundered new truths, and Rabelais jested, and Petrarch
discoursed with the doctors. Here, in the Rue de l'Ancienne
Com&eacute;die, walked the shades of Racine, of Moli&egrave;re, of
Corneille, of Voltaire. Dear, venerable, immortal old Quartier
Latin! Thy streets were narrow, but they were the arteries through
which, century after century, circulated all the wisdom and poetry,
all the art, and science, and learning of France! Their gloom,
their squalor, their very dirt was sacred. Could I have had my
will, not a stone of the old place should have been touched, not a
pavement widened, not a landmark effaced.</p>
<p>Then beside, yet not apart from, all that was medi&aelig;val and
historic in the Pays Latin, ran the gay, effervescent, laughing
current of the life of the <i>jeunessed' aujour d'hui.</i> Here
beat the very heart of that rare, that immortal, that unparalleled
<i>vie de Boh&egrave;me</i>, the vagabond poetry of which possesses
such an inexhaustible charm for even the soberest imagination. What
brick and mortar idylls, what romances <i>au cinqui&egrave;me</i>,
what joyous epithalamiums, what gay improvident
<i>m&eacute;nages</i>, what kisses, what laughter, what tears, what
lightly-spoken and lightly-broken vows those old walls could have
told of!</p>
<p>Here, apparelled in all sorts of unimaginable tailoring, in
jaunty colored cap or flapped sombrero, his pipe dangling from his
button-hole, his hair and beard displaying every eccentricity under
heaven, the Paris student, the <i>Pays Latiniste pur sang</i>,
lived and had his being. Poring over the bookstalls in the Place du
Panth&eacute;on or the Rue des Gr&egrave;s--hurrying along towards
this or that college with a huge volume under each arm, about nine
o'clock in the morning--haunting the caf&eacute;s at midday and the
restaurants at six--swinging his legs out of upper windows and
smoking in his shirt-sleeves in the summer evenings--crowding the
pit of the Od&eacute;on and every part of the Theatre du
Panth&eacute;on--playing wind instruments at dead of night to the
torment of his neighbors, or, in vocal mood, traversing the
Quartier with a society of musical friends about the small hours of
the morning--getting into scuffles with the gendarmes--flirting,
dancing, playing billiards and the deuce; falling in love and in
debt; dividing his time between Aristotle and Mademoiselle Mimi
Pinson ... here, and here only, in all his phases, at every hour of
the day and night, he swarmed, ubiquitous.</p>
<p>And here, too (a necessary sequence), flourished the fair and
frail grisette. Her race, alas! is now all but extinct--the race of
Fr&eacute;tillon, of Francine, of Lisette, Musette, Rosette, and
all the rest of that too fascinating terminology--the race
immortalized again and again by B&eacute;ranger, Gavarni, Balzac,
De Musset; sketched by a hundred pencils and described by a hundred
pens; celebrated in all manner of metres and set to all manner of
melodies; now caricatured and now canonized; now painted wholly
<i>en noir</i> and now all <i>couleur de rose</i>; yet, however
often described, however skilfully analyzed, remaining for ever
indescribable, and for ever defying analysis!</p>
<p>"De tous les produits Parisiens," says Monsieur Jules Janin
(himself the quintessence of everything most Parisian), "le produit
le plus Parisien, sans contredit, c'est la grisette." True; but our
epigrammatist should have gone a step farther. He should have added
that the grisette <i>pur sang</i> is to be found nowhere except in
Paris; and (still a step farther) nowhere in Paris save between the
Pont Neuf and the Barri&egrave;re d'Enfer. There she reigns; there
(ah! let me use the delicious present tense--let me believe that I
still live in Arcadia!)--there she lights up the old streets with
her smile; makes the old walls ring with her laughter; flits over
the crossings like a fairy; wears the most coquettish of little
caps and the daintiest of little shoes; rises to her work with the
dawn; keeps a pet canary; trains a nasturtium round her window;
loves as heartily as she laughs, and almost as readily; owes not a
sou, saves not a centime; sews on Adolphe's buttons, like a good
neighbor; is never so happy as when Adolphe in return takes her to
Tivoli or the Jardin Turc; adores <i>galette, sucre d'orge</i>, and
Frederick Lema&icirc;tre; and looks upon a masked ball and a
debardeur dress as the summit of human felicity.</p>
<p><i>Vive la grisette</i>! Shall I not follow many an illustrious
example and sing my modest paean in her praise? Frown not, august
Britannia! Look not so severely askance upon my poor little heroine
of the Quartier Latin! Thinkest thou because thou art so eminently
virtuous that she who has many a serviceable virtue of her own,
shall be debarred from her share in this world's cakes and ale?</p>
<p><i>Vive la grisette</i>! Let us think and speak no evil of her.
"Elle ne tient au vice que par un rayon, et s'en &eacute;loigne par
les mille autres points de la circonference sociale." The world
sees only her follies, and sees them at first sight; her good
qualities lie hidden in the shade. Is she not busy as a bee, joyous
as a lark, helpful, pitiful, unselfish, industrious, contented? How
often has she not slipped her last coin into the alms-box at the
hospital gate, and gone supperless to bed? How often sat up all
night, after a long day's toil in a crowded work-room, to nurse
Victorine in the fever? How often pawned her Sunday gown and shawl,
to redeem that coat without which Adolphe cannot appear before the
examiners to-morrow morning? Granted, if you will, that she has an
insatiable appetite for sweets, cigarettes, and theatrical
admissions--shall she not be welcome to her tastes? And is it her
fault if her capacity in the way of miscellaneous refreshments
partakes of the nature of the miraculous--somewhat to the
inconvenience of Adolphe, who has overspent his allowance?
Supposing even that she may now and then indulge (among friends) in
a very modified can-can at the Chaumi&egrave;re--what does that
prove, except that her heels are as light as her heart, and that
her early education has been somewhat neglected?</p>
<p>But I am writing of a world that has vanished as completely as
the lost Pleiad. The Quartier Latin of my time is no more. The
Chaumi&egrave;re is no more. The grisette is fast dying out. Of the
Rue de la Harpe not a recognisable feature is left. The old Place
St. Michel, the fountain, the Theatre du Panth&eacute;on, are gone
as if they had never been. Whole streets, I might say whole
parishes, have been swept away--whole chapters of medi&aelig;val
history erased for ever.</p>
<p>Well, I love to close my eyes from time to time, and evoke the
dear old haunts from their ruins; to descend once more the perilous
steeps of the Rue St. Jacques, and to thread the labyrinthine
by-streets that surround the &Eacute;cole de M&eacute;decine. I see
them all so plainly! I look in at the familiar print-shops--I meet
many a long-forgotten face--I hear many a long-forgotten voice--I
am twenty years of age and a student again!</p>
<p>Ah me! what a pleasant time, and what a land of enchantment!
Dingy, dilapidated, decrepit as it was, that graceless old Quartier
Latin, believe me, was paved with roses and lighted with laughing
gas.</p>

<h3>THE FETE AT COURBEVOIE.</h3>
<br>
<p>"<i>Halte l&agrave;</i>! I thought I should catch you about this
time! They've been giving you unconscionable good measure to-day,
though, haven't they? I thought Bollinet's lecture was always over
by three; and here I've been moralizing on the flight of Time for
more than twenty minutes."</p>
<p>So saying, M&uuml;ller, having stopped me as I was coming down
the steps of the H&ocirc;tel Dieu, linked his arm in mine, drew me
into a shady angle under the lee of Notre Dame, and, without
leaving me time to reply, went on pouring out his light, eager
chatter as readily as a mountain-spring bubbles out its waters.</p>
<p>"I thought you'd like to know about the Tapottes, you see--and I
was dying to tell you. I went to your rooms last night between
eight and nine, and you were out; so I thought the only sure way
was to come here--I know you never miss Bollinet's Lectures. Well,
as I was saying, the Tapottes.... Oh, <i>mon cher</i>! I am your
debtor for life in that matter of Milord Smithfield. It has been
the making of me. What do you think? Tapotte is not only going to
sit for a companion half-length to Madame's portrait, but he has
given me a commission for half-a-dozen ancestors.
Fancy--half-a-dozen illustrious dead-and-done Tapottes! What a
scope for the imagination! What a bewildering vista of <i>billets
de banque</i>! I feel--ah, <i>mon ami</i>! I feel that the wildest
visions of my youth are about to be realized, and that I shall see
my tailor's bill receipted before I die!"</p>
<p>"I'm delighted," said I, "that Tapotte has turned up a trump
card."</p>
<p>"A trump card? Say a California--a Pactolus--a Golden Calf. Nay,
hath not Tapotte two golden calves? Is he not of the precious metal
all compact? Stands he not, in the amiable ripeness of his years, a
living representative of the Golden Age? <i>'O bella et&agrave;
dell' oro</i>!'"</p>
<p>And to my horror, he then and there executed a frantic <i>pas
seul</i>.</p>
<p>"Gracious powers!" I exclaimed. "Are you mad?"</p>
<p>"Yes--raving mad. Have you any objection?"</p>
<p>"But, my dear fellow--in the face of day--in the streets of
Paris! We shall get taken up by the police!"</p>
<p>"Then suppose we get out of the streets of Paris? I'm tired
enough, Heaven knows, of cultivating the arid soil of the
Pav&eacute;. See, it's a glorious afternoon. Let's go
somewhere."</p>
<p>"With all my heart. Where?"</p>
<p>"<i>Ah, mon Dieu! &ccedil;a m'est &eacute;gal</i>.
Enghien--Vincennes--St. Cloud--Versailles ... anywhere you like.
Most probably there's a f&ecirc;te going on somewhere, if we only
knew where,"</p>
<p>"Can't we find out?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes--we can drop into a Caf&eacute; and look at the
<i>Petites Affiches</i>; only that entails an absinthe; or we can
go into the nearest Omnibus Bureau and see the notices on the
walls, which will be cheaper."</p>
<p>So we threaded our way along the narrow thoroughfares of the Ile
de la Cit&eacute;, and came presently to an Omnibus Bureau on the
Quai de l'Horloge, overlooking the Pont Neuf and the river. Here
the first thing we saw was a flaming placard setting forth the
pleasures and attractions of the great annual f&ecirc;te at
Courbevoie; a village on the banks of the Seine, a mile or two
beyond Neuilly.</p>
<p>"<i>Voil&agrave;, notre affaire</i>!" said M&uuml;ller, gaily.
"We can't do better than steer straight for Courbevoie."</p>
<p>Saying which, he hailed a passing fiacre and bade the coachman
drive to the Embarcad&egrave;re of the Rive Droite.</p>
<p>"We shall amuse ourselves famously at Courbevoie," he said, as
we rattled over the stones. "We'll dine at the Toison d'Or--an
excellent little restaurant overlooking the river; and if you're
fond of angling, we can hire a punt and catch our own fish for
dinner. Then there will be plenty of fiddling and dancing at the
guingettes and gardens in the evening. By the way, though, I've no
money! That is to say, none worth speaking
of--<i>voil&agrave;!</i>... one franc, one piece of fifty centimes,
another of twenty centimes, and some sous. I hope your pockets are
better lined than mine."</p>
<p>"Not much, I fear," I replied, pulling out my porte-monnaie, and
emptying the contents into my hand. They amounted to nine francs
and seventy-five centimes.</p>
<p>"<i>Parbleu</i>! we've just eleven francs and a half between
us," said M&uuml;ller. "A modest sum-total; but we must make it as
elastic as we can. Let me see, there'll be a franc for the fiacre,
four francs for our return tickets, four for our dinner, and two
and a half to spend as we like in the fair. Well, we can't commit
any great extravagance with that amount of floating capital."</p>
<p>"Better turn back and go to my rooms for some more money?" I
exclaimed. "I've two Napoleons in my desk."</p>
<p>"No, no--we should miss the three-fifty train, and not get
another till between five and six."</p>
<p>"But we shall have no fun if we have no money!"</p>
<p>"I dissent entirely from that proposition, Monsieur Englishman.
I have always had plenty of fun, and I have been short of cash
since the hour of my birth. Come, it shall be my proud task to-day
to prove to you the pleasures of impecuniosity!"</p>
<p>So with our eleven francs and a half we went on to the station,
and took our places for Courbevoie.</p>
<p>We travelled, of course, by third class in the open wagons; and
it so happened that in our compartment we had the company of three
pretty little chattering grisettes, a fat countrywoman with a
basket, and a quiet-looking elderly female with her niece. These
last wore bonnets, and some kind of slight mourning. They belonged
evidently to the small bourgeoise class, and sat very quietly in
the corner of the carriage, speaking to no one. The three
grisettes, however, kept up an incessant fire of small talk and
squabble.</p>
<p>"I was on this very line last Sunday," said one. "I went with
Julie to Asni&egrave;res, and we were so gay! I wonder if it will
be very gay at Courbevoie."</p>
<p>"<i>Je m'en doute</i>," replied another, whom they called
Lolotte. "I came to one of the Courbevoie f&ecirc;tes last spring,
and it was not gay at all. But then, to be sure, I was with
Edouard, and he is as dull as the first day in Lent. Where were you
last Sunday, Ad&eacute;le?"</p>
<p>"I did not go beyond the barriers. I went to the Cirque with my
cousin, and we dined in the Palais Royal. We enjoyed ourselves so
much! You know my cousin?"</p>
<p>"Ah! yes--the little fellow with the curly hair and the
whiskers, who waits for you at the corner when we leave the
workshop."</p>
<p>"The same--Achille."</p>
<p>"Your Achille is nice-looking," said Mademoiselle Lolotte, with
a somewhat critical air. "It is a pity he squints."</p>
<p>"He does not squint, mam'selle."</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>ma ch&egrave;re</i>! I appeal to Caroline."</p>
<p>"I am not sure that he actually squints," said Mam'selle
Caroline, speaking for the first time; "but he certainly has one
eye larger than the other, and of quite a different color."</p>
<p>"<i>Tiens</i>, Caroline--it seems to me that you look very
closely into the eyes of young men," exclaims Ad&egrave;le, turning
sharply upon this new assailant.</p>
<p>"At all events you admit that Caroline is right," cries Lolotte,
triumphantly.</p>
<p>"I admit nothing of the kind. I say that you are both very
ill-natured, and that you say what is not true. As for you,
Lolotte, I don't believe you ever had the chance of seeing a young
man's eyes turned upon you, or you would not be so pleased with the
attentions of an old one."</p>
<p>"An <i>old</i> one!" shrieked Mam'selle Lolotte. "Ah, <i>mon
Dieu</i>! Is a man old at forty-seven? Monsieur Durand is in the
prime of life, and there isn't a girl in the Quartier who would not
be proud of his attentions!"</p>
<p>"He's sixty, if an hour," said the injured Ad&egrave;le. "And as
for you, Caroline, who have never had a beau in your life...."</p>
<p>"<i>Ciel</i>! what a calumny!--I--never had a ... Holy Saint
Genevi&egrave;ve! why, it was only last Thursday week...."</p>
<p>Here the train stopped at the Asni&egrave;res station, and two
privates of the Garde Imp&eacute;riale got into the carriage. The
horizon cleared as if by magic. The grisettes suddenly forgot their
differences, and began to chat quite amicably. The soldiers twirled
their mustachios, listened, smiled, and essayed to join in the
conversation. In a few minutes all was mirth and flirtation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile M&uuml;ller was casting admiring glances on the young
girl in the corner, whilst the fat countrywoman, pursing up her
mouth, and watching the grisettes and soldiers, looked the image of
offended virtue.</p>
<p>"Dame! Madame," she said, addressing herself to the old lady in
the bonnet, "girls usen't to be so forward in the days when you and
I were young!"</p>
<p>To which the old lady in the bonnet, blandly smiling,
replied:--</p>
<p>"Beautiful, for the time of year."</p>
<p>"Eh? For the time of year? Dame! I don't see that the time of
year has anything to do with it," exclaimed the fat
countrywoman.</p>
<p>Here the young girl in the corner, blushing and smiling very
sweetly, interposed with--"Pardon, Madame--my aunt is somewhat
deaf. Pray, excuse her."</p>
<p>Whereupon the old lady, watching the motion of her niece's lips,
added--</p>
<p>"Ah, yes--yes! I am a poor, deaf old woman--I don't understand
what you say. Talk to my little Marie, here--she can answer
you."</p>
<p>"I, for one, desire nothing better than permission to talk to
Mademoiselle," said M&uuml;ller, gallantly.</p>
<p><i>"Mais, Monsieur</i>..."</p>
<p>"Mademoiselle, with Madame her aunt, are going to the f&ecirc;te
at Courbevoie?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Monsieur."</p>
<p>"The river is very pretty thereabouts, and the walks through the
meadows are delightful."</p>
<p>"Indeed, Monsieur!"</p>
<p>"Mademoiselle does not know the place?"</p>
<p>"No, Monsieur."</p>
<p>"Ah, if I might only be permitted to act as guide! I know every
foot of the ground about Courbevoie."</p>
<p>Mademoiselle Marie blushed again, looked down, and made no
reply.</p>
<p>"I am a painter," continued M&uuml;ller; "and I have sketched
all the windings of the Seine from Neuilly to St. Germains. My
friend here is English--he is a student of medicine, and speaks
excellent French."</p>
<p>"What is the gentleman saying, <i>mon enfant</i>?" asked the old
lady, somewhat anxiously.</p>
<p>"Monsieur says that the river is very pretty about Courbevoie,
<i>ma tante</i>," replied Mademoiselle Marie, raising her
voice.</p>
<p>"Ah! ah! and what else?"</p>
<p>"Monsieur is a painter."</p>
<p>"A painter? Ah, dear me! it's an unhealthy occupation. My poor
brother Pierre might have been alive to this day if he had taken to
any other line of business! You must take great care of your lungs,
young man. You look delicate."</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller laughed, shook his head, and declared at the top of
his voice that he had never had a day's illness in his life.</p>
<p>Here the pretty niece again interposed.</p>
<p>"Ah, Monsieur," she said, "my aunt does not understand....My--my
uncle Pierre was a house-painter."</p>
<p>"A very respectable occupation, Mademoiselle," replied
M&uuml;ller, politely. "For my own part, I would sooner paint the
insides of some houses than the outsides of some people."</p>
<p>At this moment the train began to slacken pace, and the steam
was let off with a demoniac shriek.</p>
<p>"<i>Tiens, mon enfant</i>," said the old lady, turning towards
her niece with affectionate anxiety. "I hope you have not taken
cold."</p>
<p>The excellent soul believed that it was Mademoiselle Marie who
sneezed.</p>
<p>And now the train had stopped--the porters were running along
the platform, shouting "Courbevoie! Courbevoie!"--the passengers
were scrambling out <i>en masse</i>--and beyond the barrier one saw
a confused crowd of <i>charrette</i> and omnibus-drivers, touters,
fruit-sellers, and idlers of every description. M&uuml;ller handed
out the old lady and the niece; the fat countrywoman scrambled up
into a kind of tumbril driven by a boy in <i>sabots</i>; the
grisettes and soldiers walked off together; and the tide of
holiday-makers, some on foot, some in hired vehicles, set towards
the village. In the meanwhile, what with the crowd on the platform
and the crowd outside the barrier, and what with the hustling and
pushing at the point where the tickets were taken, we lost sight of
the old lady and her niece.</p>
<p>"What the deuce has become of <i>ma tante</i>?" exclaimed
M&uuml;ller, looking round.</p>
<p>But neither <i>ma tante</i> nor Mademoiselle Marie were anywhere
to be seen. I suggested that they must have gone on in the omnibus
or taken a <i>charrette</i>, and so have passed us unperceived.</p>
<p>"And, after all," I added, "we didn't want to enter upon an
indissoluble union with them for the rest of the day. <i>Ma
tante's</i> deafness is not entertaining, and <i>la petite</i>
Marie has nothing to say."</p>
<p>"<i>La petite</i> Marie is uncommonly pretty, though," said
M&uuml;ller. "I mean to dance a quadrille with her by-and-by, I
promise you."</p>
<p>"<i>A la bonne heure</i>! We shall be sure to chance upon them
again before long."</p>
<p>We had come by this time to a group of pretty villa-residences
with high garden walls and little shady side-lanes leading down to
the river. Then came a church and more houses; then an open Place;
and suddenly we found ourselves in the midst of the fair.</p>
<p>It was just like any other of the hundred and one f&ecirc;tes
that take place every summer in the environs of Paris. There was a
merry-go-round and a greasy pole; there was a juggler who swallowed
knives and ribbons; there were fortune-tellers without number;
there were dining-booths, and drinking-booths, and dancing-booths;
there were acrobats, organ-boys with monkeys, and Savoyards with
white mice; there were stalls for the sale of cakes, fruit,
sweetmeats, toys, combs, cheap jewelry, glass, crockery, boots and
shoes, holy-water vessels, rosaries, medals, and little colored
prints of saints and martyrs; there were brass bands, and string
bands, and ballad-singers everywhere; and there was an atmosphere
compounded of dust, tobacco-smoke, onions, musk, and every
objectionable perfume under heaven.</p>
<p>"Dine at the Restaurant de l'Empire, Messieurs," shouted a
shabby touter in a blouse, thrusting a greasy card into our faces.
"Three dishes, a dessert, a half-bottle, and a band of music, for
one franc-fifty. The cheapest dinner in the fair!"</p>
<p>"The cheapest dinner in the fair is at the Belle Gabrielle!"
cried another. "We'll give you for the same money soup, fish, two
dishes, a dessert, a half-bottle, and take your photograph into the
bargain!"</p>
<p>"Bravo! <i>mon vieux</i>--you first poison them with your
dinner, and then provide photographs for the widows and children,"
retorts touter number one. "That's justice, anyhow."</p>
<p>Whereupon touter number two shrieks out a torrent of abuse, and
we push on, leaving them to settle their differences after their
own fashion.</p>
<p>At the next booth we are accosted by a burly fellow daubed to
the eyes with red and blue paint, and dressed as an Indian
chief.</p>
<p>"<i>Entrez, entrez, Messieurs et Mesdames</i>" he cries,
flourishing a war-spear some nine feet in length. "Come and see the
wonderful Peruvian maiden of Tanjore, with webbed fingers and toes,
her mouth in the back of her head, and her eyes in the soles of her
feet! Only four sous each, and an opportunity that will never occur
again!"</p>
<p>"Only fifty centimes!" shouts another public orator; "the most
ingenious little machine ever invented! Goes into the waistcoat
pocket--is wound up every twenty-four hours--tells the day of the
month, the day of the year, the age of the moon, the state of the
Bourse, the bank rate of discount, the quarter from which the wind
is blowing, the price of new-laid eggs in Paris and the provinces,
the rate of mortality in the Fee-jee islands, and the state of your
sweetheart's affections!"</p>
<p>A little further on, by dint of much elbowing, we made our way
into a crowded booth where, for the modest consideration of two
sous per head, might be seen a Boneless Youth and an Ashantee King.
The performances were half over when we went in. The Boneless Youth
had gone through his feats of agility, and was lying on a mat in a
corner of the stage, the picture of limp incapability. The Ashantee
monarch was just about to make his appearance. Meanwhile, a little
man in fleshings and a cocked hat addressed the audience.</p>
<p>"Messieurs and Mesdames--I have the honor to announce that
Caraba Radokala, King of Ashantee, will next appear before you.
This terrific native sovereign was taken captive by that famous
Dutch navigator, the Mynheer Van Dunk, in his last voyage round the
globe. Van Dunk, having brought his prisoner to Europe in an iron
cage, sold him to the English government in 1840; who sold him
again to Milord Barnum, the great American philanthropist, in 1842;
who sold him again to Franconi of the Cirque Olympique; who finally
sold him to me. At the time of his capture, Caraba Radokala was the
most treacherous, barbarous, and sanguinary monster upon record. He
had three hundred and sixty-five wives--a wife, you observe, for
every day in the year. He lived exclusively upon human flesh, and
consumed, when in good health, one baby per diem. His palace in
Ashantee was built entirely of the skulls and leg-bones of his
victims. He is now, however, much less ferocious; and, though he
feeds on live pigeons, rabbits, dogs, mice, and the like, he has
not tasted human flesh since his captivity. He is also heavily
ironed. The distinguished company need therefore entertain no
apprehensions. Pierre--draw the bolt, and let his majesty
loose!"</p>
<p>A savage roar was now heard, followed by a rattling of chains.
Then the curtains were suddenly drawn back, and the Ashantee
king--crowned with a feather head-dress, loaded with red and blue
war-paint, and chained from ankle to ankle--bounded on the
stage.</p>
<p>Seeing the audience before him, he uttered a terrific howl. The
front rows were visibly agitated. Several young women faintly
screamed.</p>
<p>The little man in the cocked hat rushed to the front, protesting
that the ladies had no reason to be alarmed. Caraba Radokala, if
not wantonly provoked, was now quite harmless--a little irritable,
perhaps, from being waked too suddenly--would be as gentle as a
lamb, if given something to eat:--"Pierre, quiet his majesty with a
pigeon!"</p>
<p>Pierre, a lank lad in motley, hereupon appeared with a live
pigeon, which immediately escaped from his hands and perched on the
top of the proscenium. Caraba Radokala yelled; the little man in
the cocked hat raved; and Pierre, in default of more pigeons,
contritely reappeared with a lump of raw beef, into which his
majesty ravenously dug his royal teeth. The pigeon, meanwhile,
dressed its feathers and looked complacently down, as if used to
the incident.</p>
<p>"Having fed, Caraba Radokala will now be quite gentle and
good-humored," said the showman. "If any lady desires to shake
hands with him, she may do so with perfect safety. Will any lady
embrace the opportunity?"</p>
<p>A faint sound of tittering was heard in various parts of the
booth; but no one came forward.</p>
<p>"Will <i>no</i> lady be persuaded? Well, then, is there any
gentleman present who speaks Ashantee?"</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller gave me a dig with his elbow, and started to his
feet.</p>
<p>"Yes," he replied, loudly. "I do."</p>
<p>Every head was instantly turned in our direction.</p>
<p>The showman collapsed with astonishment. Even the captive,
despite his ignorance of the French tongue, looked considerably
startled.</p>
<p>"<i>Comment</i>!" stammered the cocked hat. "Monsieur speaks
Ashantee?"</p>
<p>"Fluently."</p>
<p>"Is it permitted to inquire how and when monsieur acquired this
very unusual accomplishment?"</p>
<p>"I have spoken Ashantee from my infancy," replied M&uuml;ller,
with admirable aplomb. "I was born at sea, brought up in an
undiscovered island, twice kidnapped by hostile tribes before
attaining the age of ten years, and have lived among savage nations
all my life."</p>
<p>A murmur of admiration ran through the audience, and M&uuml;ller
became, for the time, an object of livelier interest than Caraba
Radokala himself. Seeing this, the indignant monarch executed a
warlike <i>pas</i>, and rattled his chains fiercely.</p>
<p>"In that case, monsieur, you had better come upon the stage, and
speak to his majesty," said the showman reluctantly.</p>
<p>"With all the pleasure in life."</p>
<p>"But I warn you that his temper is uncertain."</p>
<p>"Bah!" said M&uuml;ller, working his way round through the
crowd, "I'm not afraid of his temper."</p>
<p>"As monsieur pleases--but, if monsieur offends him, <i>I</i>
will not be answerable for the consequences."</p>
<p>"All right--give us a hand up, <i>mon vieux</i>!" And Muller,
having clambered upon the stage, made a bow to the audience and a
salaam to his majesty.</p>
<p>"Chickahominy chowdar bang," said he, by way of opening the
conversation.</p>
<p>The ex-king of Ashantee scowled, folded his arms, and maintained
a haughty silence.</p>
<p>"Hic hac horum, high cockalorum," continued M&uuml;ller, with
exceeding suavity.</p>
<p>The captive monarch stamped impatiently, ground his teeth, but
still made no reply.</p>
<p>"Monsieur had better not aggravate him," said the showman. "On
the contrary--I am overwhelming him with civilities Now observe--I
condole with him upon his melancholy position. I inquire after his
wives and children; and I remark how uncommonly well he is
looking."</p>
<p>And with this, he made another salaam, smiled persuasively, and
said--</p>
<p>"Alpha, beta, gamma, delta--chin-chin--Potz
tausend!--Erin-go-bragh!"</p>
<p>"Borriobooloobah!" shrieked his majesty, apparently stung to
desperation.</p>
<p>"Rocofoco!" retorted M&uuml;ller promptly.</p>
<p>But as if this last was more than any Ashantee temper could
bear, Caraba Rodokala clenched both his fists, set his teeth hard,
and charged down upon M&uuml;ller like a wild elephant. Being met,
however, by a well-planted blow between the eyes, he went down like
a ninepin--picked himself up,--rushed in again, and, being forcibly
seized and held back by the cocked hat, Pierre of the pigeons, and
a third man who came tumbling up precipitately from somewhere
behind the stage, vented his fury, in a torrent of very highly
civilized French oaths.</p>
<p>"Eh, <i>sacredieu</i>!" he cried, shaking his fist in
M&uuml;ller's face, "I've not done with you yet, <i>diable de
gal&eacute;rien</i>!"</p>
<p>Whereupon there burst forth a general roar--a roar like the
"inextinguishable laughter" of Olympus.</p>
<p>"<i>Tiens</i>!" said M&uuml;ller, "his majesty speaks French
almost as well as I speak Ashantee!"</p>
<p>"<i>Bourreau! Brigand! Assassin</i>!" shrieked his Ferocity, as
his friends hustled him off the stage.</p>
<p>The curtains then fell together again; and the audience, still
laughing vociferously, dispersed with cries of "Vive Caraba
Rodokala!" "Kind remembrances to the Queens of Ashantee!" "What's
the latest news from home?" "Borriobooloo-bah--ah--ah!"</p>
<p>Elbowing our way out with the crowd, we now plunged once more
into the press of the fair. Here our old friends the dancing dogs
of the Champs Elys&eacute;es, and the familiar charlatan of the
Place du Ch&acirc;telet with his chariot and barrel-organ,
transported us from Ashantee to Paris. Next we came to a temporary
shooting-gallery, adorned over the entrance with a spirited cartoon
of a Tyrolean sharpshooter; and then to an exhibition of
cosmoramas; and presently to a weighing machine, in which a great,
rosy-cheeked, laughing Normandy peasant girl, with her high cap,
blue skirt, massive gold cross and heavy ear-rings, was in the act
of being weighed.</p>
<p>"<i>Tiens! Mam'selle est joliment solide</i>!" remarks a saucy
bystander, as the owner of the machine piles on weight after
weight.</p>
<p>"Perhaps if I had no more brains than m'sieur, I should weigh as
light!" retorts the damsel, with a toss of her high cap.</p>
<p>"<i>Pardon</i>! it is not a question of brains--it is a question
of hearts," interposes an elderly exquisite in a white hat.
"Mam'selle has captured so many that she is completely over
weighted."</p>
<p>"Twelve stone six ounces," pronounces the owner of the machine,
adjusting the last weight.</p>
<p>Whereupon there is a burst of ironical applause, and the big
<i>paysanne</i>, half laughing, half angry, walks off, exclaiming,
"<i>Eh bien! tant mieux</i>! I've no mind to be a
scarecrow--<i>moi</i>!"</p>
<p>By this time we have both had enough of the fair, and are glad
to make our way out of the crowd and down to the riverside. Here we
find lovers strolling in pairs along the towing-path; family groups
pic-nicking in the shade; boats and punts for hire, and a
swimming-match just coming off, of which all that is visible are
two black heads bobbing up and down along the middle of the
stream.</p>
<p>"And now, <i>mon ami</i>, what do you vote for?" asks
M&uuml;ller. "Boating or fishing? or both? or neither?"</p>
<p>"Both, if you like--but I never caught anything in my life,"</p>
<p>"The pleasure of fishing, I take it," says M&uuml;ller, "is not
in the fish you catch, but in the fish you miss. The fish you catch
is a poor little wretch, worth neither the trouble of landing,
cooking, nor eating; but the fish you miss is always the finest
fellow you ever saw in your life!"</p>
<p>"<i>Allons donc</i>! I know, then, which of us two will have
most of the pleasure to-day," I reply, laughing. "But how about the
expense?"</p>
<p>To which M&uuml;ller, with a noble recklessness, answers:--</p>
<p>"Oh, hang the expense! Here, boatman! a boat <i>&agrave; quatre
rames</i>, and some fishing-tackle--by the hour."</p>
<p>Now it was undoubtedly a fine sentiment this of M&uuml;ller's,
and had we but fetched my two Napoleons before starting, I should
have applauded it to the echo; but when I considered that something
very nearly approaching to a franc had already filtered out of our
pockets in passing through the fair, and that the hour of dinner
was looming somewhat indefinitely in the distance, I confess that
my soul became disquieted within me.</p>
<p>"Don't forget, for heaven's sake," I said, "that we must keep
something for dinner!"</p>
<p>"My dear fellow," he replied, "I have already a tremendous
appetite for dinner--that <i>is</i> something."</p>
<p>After this, I resigned myself to whatever might happen.</p>
<p>We then rowed up the river for about a mile beyond Courbevoie.
moored our boat to a friendly willow, put our fishing-tackle
together, and composed ourselves for the gentle excitement that
waits upon the gudgeon and the minnow.</p>
<p>"I haven't yet had a single nibble," said M&uuml;ller, when we
had been sitting to our work for something less than ten
minutes.</p>
<p>"Hush!" I said. "You mustn't speak, you know."</p>
<p>"True--I had forgotten. I'll sing instead. Fishes, I have been
told, are fond of music.</p>
<blockquote>'Fanfan, je vous aimerais bien;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Contre vous je n'ai nul caprice;<br>
Vous &ecirc;tes gentil, j'en convien....'"</blockquote>
<p>"Come, now!" I exclaimed pettishly, "this is really too bad. I
had a bite--a most decided bite--and if you had only kept
quiet"....</p>
<p>"Nonsense, my dear fellow! I tell you again--and I have it on
the best authority--fishes like music. Did you never hear of Arion!
Have you forgotten about the Syrens? Believe me, your gudgeon
nibbled because I sang him to the surface--just as the snakes come
out for the song of the snake-charmer. I'll try again!"</p>
<p>And with this he began:--</p>
<blockquote>"Jeannette est une brune<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Qui demeure &agrave; Pantin,<br>
O&ugrave; toute sa fortune<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Est un petit jardin!"</blockquote>
<p>"Well, if you go on like that, all I have to say is, that not a
fish will come within half a mile of our bait," said I, with
tranquil despair.</p>
<p>"Alas! <i>mon cher</i>, I am grieved to observe in your
otherwise estimable character, a melancholy want of faith," replied
M&uuml;ller "Without faith, what is friendship? What is angling?
What is matrimony? Now, I tell you that with regard to the finny
tribe, the more I charm them, the more enthusiastically they will
flock to be caught. We shall have a miraculous draught in a few
minutes, if you are but patient."</p>
<p>And then he began again:--</p>
<blockquote>"Mimi Pinson est une blonde,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Une blonde que l'on conna&icirc;t.<br>
Elle n'a qu'une robe au monde,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Landerirette!<br>
Et qu'un bonnet."</blockquote>
<p>I laid aside my rod, folded my arms, and when he had done,
applauded ironically.</p>
<p>"Very good," I said. "I understand the situation. We are here,
at some--indeed, I may say, considering the state of our exchequer,
at a considerable mutual expense; not to catch fish, but to afford
Herr M&uuml;ller an opportunity of exercising his extensive memory,
and his limited baritone voice. The entertainment is not without
its <i>agr&eacute;ments</i>, but I find it dear at the price."</p>
<p>"<i>Tiens</i>, Arbuthnot! let us fish seriously. I promise not
to open my lips again till you have caught something."</p>
<p>"Then, seriously, I believe you would have to be silent the
whole night, and all I should catch would be the rheumatism. I am
the worst angler in the world, and the most unlucky."</p>
<p>"Really and truly?"</p>
<p>"Really and truly. And you?"</p>
<p>"As bad as yourself. If a tolerably large and energetic fish did
me the honor to swallow my bait, the probability is that he would
catch me. I certainly shouldn't know what to do with him."</p>
<p>"Then the present question is--what shall we do with
ourselves?"</p>
<p>"I vote that we row up as far as yonder bend in the river, just
to see what lies beyond; and then back to Courbevoie."</p>
<p>"Heaven only grant that by that time we shall have enough money
left for dinner!" I murmured with a sigh.</p>
<p>We rowed up the river as far as the first bend, a distance of
about half a mile; and then we rowed on as far as the next bend.
Then we turned, and, resting on our oars, drifted slowly back with
the current. The evening was indescribably brilliant and serene.
The sky was cloudless, of a greenish blue, and full of light. The
river was clear as glass. We could see the flaccid water-weeds
swaying languidly with the current far below, and now and then a
shoal of tiny fish shooting along half-way between the weeds and
the surface. A rich fringe of purple iris, spear-leaved
sagittarius, and tufted meadow-sweet (each blossom a bouquet on a
slender thyrsus) bordered the towing-path and filled the air with
perfume. Here the meadows lay open to the water's edge; a little
farther on, they were shut off by a close rampart of poplars and
willows whose leaves, already yellowed by autumn, were now fiery in
the sunset. Joyous bands of gnats, like wild little intoxicated
maenads, circled and hummed about our heads as we drifted slowly
on; while, far away and mellowed by distance, we heard the brazen
music of the fair.</p>
<p>We were both silent. M&uuml;ller pulled out a small sketch-book
and made a rapid study of the scene--the reach in the river; the
wooded banks; the green flats traversed by long lines of stunted
pollards; the church-tops and roofs of Courbevoie beyond.</p>
<p>Presently a soft voice, singing, broke upon the silence.
M&uuml;ller stopped involuntarily, pencil in hand. I held my
breath, and listened. The tune was flowing and sweet; and as our
boat drifted on, the words of the singer became audible.</p>
<blockquote>"O miroir ondoyant!<br>
Je r&egrave;ve en te voyant<br>
Harmonie et lumi&egrave;re,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O ma rivi&egrave;re,<br>
O ma belle rivi&egrave;re!<br>
<br>
"On voit se r&eacute;fl&eacute;chir<br>
Dans ses eaux les nuages;<br>
Elle semble dormir<br>
Entre les p&acirc;turages<br>
<br>
O&ugrave; paissent les grands boeufs<br>
Et les grasses genisses.<br>
Au p&acirc;tres amoureux<br>
Que ses bords sont propices!"</blockquote>
<p>"A woman's voice," said M&uuml;ller. "Dupont's words and music.
She must be young and pretty ... where has she hidden herself?"</p>
<p>The unseen singer, meanwhile, went on with another verse.</p>
<blockquote>"Pr&egrave;s des iris du bord,<br>
Sous une berge haute,<br>
La carpe aux reflets d'or<br>
O&ugrave; le barbeau ressaute,<br>
Les goujons font le guet,<br>
L'Ablette qui scintille<br>
Fuit le dent du brochet;<br>
Au fond rampe l'anguille!<br>
<br>
"O miroir ondoyant!<br>
Je r&egrave;ve en te voyant<br>
Harmonic et lumi&egrave;re,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O ma rivi&egrave;re,<br>
O ma belle rivi&egrave;re!"</blockquote>
<p>"Look!" said M&uuml;ller. "Do you not see them yonder--two women
under the trees? By Jupiter! it's <i>ma tante</i> and <i>la
petite</i> Marie!"</p>
<p>Saying which, he flung himself upon his oars and began pulling
vigorously towards the shore.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV."></a>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
<h3>THAT TERRIBLE M&Uuml;LLER.</h3>
<br>
<p>La petite Marie broke off at the sound of our oars, and blushed
a becoming rose-color.</p>
<p>"Will these ladies do us the honor of letting us row them back
to Courbevoie?" said M&uuml;ller, running our boat close in against
the sedges, and pulling off his hat as respectfully as if they were
duchesses.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle Marie repeated the invitation to her aunt, who
accepted it at once.</p>
<p>"<i>Tr&egrave;s volontiers, tr&egrave;s volontiers,
messieurs</i>" she said, smiling and nodding. "We have rambled out
so far--so far! And I am not as young as I was forty years ago.
<i>Ah, mon Dieu</i>! how my old bones ache! Give me thy hand,
Marie, and thank the gentlemen for their politeness."</p>
<p>So Mam'selle Marie helped her aunt to rise, and we steadied the
boat close under the bank, at a point where the interlacing roots
of a couple of sallows made a kind of natural step by means of
which they could easily get down.</p>
<p>"Oh, dear! dear! it will not turn over, will it, my dear young
man? <i>Ciel</i>! I am slipping ... Ah, <i>Dieu, merci</i>!--Marie,
<i>mon cher enfant</i>, pray be careful not to jump in, or you will
upset us all!"</p>
<p>And <i>ma tante</i>, somewhat tremulous from the ordeal of
embarking, settled down in her place, while M&uuml;ller lifted
Mam'selle Marie into the boat, as if she had been a child. I then
took the oars, leaving him to steer; and so we pursued our way
towards Courbevoie.</p>
<p>"Mam'selle has of course seen the fair?" said M&uuml;ller, from
behind the old lady's back.</p>
<p>"No, monsieur,"</p>
<p>"No! Is it possible?"</p>
<p>"There was so much crowd, monsieur, and such a noise ... we were
quite too much afraid to venture in."</p>
<p>"Would you be afraid, mam'selle, to venture with me?"</p>
<p>"I--I do not know, monsieur."</p>
<p>"Ah, mam'selle, you might be very sure that I would take good
care of you!"</p>
<p>"<i>Mais ... monsieur</i>"...</p>
<p>"These gentlemen, I see, have been angling," said the old lady,
addressing me very graciously. "Have you caught many fish?"</p>
<p>"None at all, madame!" I replied, loudly.</p>
<p>"<i>Tiens</i>! so many as that?"</p>
<p>"<i>Pardon</i>, madame," I shouted at the top of my voice. "We
have caught nothing--nothing at all."</p>
<p><i>Ma tante</i> smiled blandly.</p>
<p>"Ah, yes," she said; "and you will have them cooked presently
for dinner, <i>n'est-ce pas</i>? There is no fish so fresh, and so
well-flavored, as the fish of our own catching."</p>
<p>"Will madame and mam'selle do us the honor to taste our fish and
share our modest dinner?" said M&uuml;ller, leaning forward in his
seat in the stern, and delivering his invitation close into the old
lady's ear.</p>
<p>To which <i>ma tante</i>, with a readiness of hearing for which
no one would have given her credit, replied:--</p>
<p>"But--but monsieur is very polite--if we should not be
inconveniencing these gentlemen"....</p>
<p>"We shall be charmed, madame--we shall be honored!"</p>
<p>"<i>Eh bien!</i> with pleasure, then--Marie, my child, thank the
gentlemen for their amiable invitation."</p>
<p>I was thunderstruck. I looked at M&uuml;ller to see if he had
suddenly gone out of his senses. Mam'selle Marie, however, was
infinitely amused.</p>
<p>"<i>Fi donc!</i> monsieur," she said. "You have no fish. I heard
the other gentleman say so."</p>
<p>"The other gentleman, mam'selle," replied M&uuml;ller, "is an
Englishman, and troubled with the spleen. You must not mind
anything he says."</p>
<p>Troubled with the spleen! I believe myself to be as
even-tempered and as ready to fall in with a joke as most men; but
I should have liked at that moment to punch Franz M&uuml;ller's
head. Gracious heavens! into what a position he had now brought us!
What was to be done? How were we to get out of it? It was now just
seven; and we had already been upon the water for more than an
hour. What should we have to pay for the boat? And when we had paid
for the boat, how much money should we have left to pay for the
dinner? Not for our own dinners--ah, no! For <i>ma tante's</i>
dinner (and <i>ma tante</i> had a hungry eye) and for <i>la
petite</i> Marie's dinner; and <i>la petite</i> Marie, plump, rosy,
and well-liking, looked as if she might have a capital appetite
upon occasion! Should we have as much as two and a half francs? I
doubted it. And then, in the absence of a miracle, what could we do
with two and a half francs, if we had them? A miserable
sum!--convertible, perhaps, into as much bouilli, bread and cheese,
and thin country wine as might have satisfied our own hunger in a
prosaic and commonplace way; but for four persons, two of them
women!...</p>
<p>And this was not the worst of it. I thought I knew M&uuml;ller
well enough by this time to feel that he would entirely dismiss
this minor consideration of ways and means; that he would order the
dinner as recklessly as if we had twenty francs apiece in our
pockets; and that he would not only order it, but eat it and
preside at it with all the gayety and audacity in life.</p>
<p>Then would come the horrible retribution of the bill!</p>
<p>I felt myself turn red and hot at the mere thought of it.</p>
<p>Then a dastardly idea insinuated itself into my mind. I had my
return-ticket in my waistcoat-pocket:--what if I slipped away
presently to the station and went back to Paris by the next train,
leaving my clever friend to improvise his way out of his own scrape
as best he could?</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, as I was rowing with the stream, we soon got
back to Courbevoie.</p>
<p>"<i>Are</i> you mad?" I said, as, having landed the ladies,
M&uuml;ller and I delivered up the boat to its owner.</p>
<p>"Didn't I admit it, two or three hours ago?" he replied. "I
wonder you don't get tired, <i>mon cher</i>, of asking the same
question so often."</p>
<p>"Four francs, fifty centimes, Messieurs," said the boatman,
having made fast his boat to the landing-place.</p>
<p>"Four francs, fifty centimes!" I echoed, in dismay.</p>
<p>Even M&uuml;ller looked aghast.</p>
<p>"My good fellow," he said, "do you take us for coiners?"</p>
<p>"Hire of boat, two francs the hour. These gentlemen have been
out nearly one hour and a half--three francs. Hire of bait and
fishing-tackle, one franc fifty. Total, four francs and a half,"
replied the boatman, putting out a great brown palm.</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller, who was acting as cashier and paymaster, pulled out
his purse, deposited one solitary half-franc in the middle of that
brown palm, and suggested that the boatman and he should toss up
for the remaining four francs--or race for them--or play for
them--or fight for them. The boatman, however, indignantly rejected
each successive proposal, and, being paid at last, retired with a
<i>decrescendo</i> of oaths.</p>
<p>"<i>Tiens</i>!" said M&uuml;ller, reflectively. "We have but one
franc left. One franc, two sous, and a centime. <i>Vive la
France!</i>"</p>
<p>"And you have actually asked that wretched old woman and her
niece to dinner!"</p>
<p>"And I have actually solicited that excellent and admirable
woman, Madame Marotte, relict of the late lamented Jacques Marotte,
umbrella maker, of number one hundred and two, Rue du Faubourg St.
Denis, and her beautiful and accomplished niece, Mademoiselle Marie
Charpentier, to honor us with their company this evening.
<i>Dis-donc,</i> what shall we give them for dinner?"</p>
<p>"Precisely what you invited them to, I should guess--the fish we
caught this afternoon."</p>
<p>"Agreed. And what else?"</p>
<p>"Say--a dish of invisible greens, and a phoenix <i>&agrave; la
Marengo</i>."</p>
<p>"You are funny, <i>mon cher</i>."</p>
<p>"Then, for fear I should become too funny--good afternoon."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"I mean that I have no mind to dine first, and be kicked out of
doors afterwards. It is one of those aids to digestion that I can
willingly dispense with."</p>
<p>"But if I guarantee that the dinner shall be paid for--money
down!"</p>
<p>"Tra la la!"</p>
<p>"You don't believe me? Well, come and see."</p>
<p>With this, he went up to Madame Marotte, who, with her niece,
had sat down on a bench under a walnut-tree close by, waiting our
pleasure.</p>
<p>"Would not these ladies prefer to rest here, while we seek for a
suitable restaurant and order the dinner?" said M&uuml;ller
insinuatingly.</p>
<p>The old lady looked somewhat blank. She was not too tired to go
on--thought it a pity to bring us all the way back again--would do,
however, as "<i>ces messieurs</i>" pleased; and so was left sitting
under the walnut-tree, reluctant and disconsolate.</p>
<p>"<i>Tiens! mon enfant</i>" I heard her say as we turned away,
"suppose they don't come back again!"</p>
<p>We had promised to be gone not longer, than twenty minutes, or
at most half an hour. M&uuml;ller led the way straight to the
<i>Toison d' Or</i>.</p>
<p>I took him by the arm as we neared the gate.</p>
<p>"Steady, steady, <i>mon gaillard</i>" I said. "We don't order
our dinner, you know, till we've found the money to pay for
it."</p>
<p>"True--but suppose I go in here to look for it?"</p>
<p>"Into the restaurant garden?"</p>
<p>"Precisely."</p>

<h3>THE PETIT COURIER ILLUSTR&Eacute;.</h3>
<br>
<p>The <i>Toison d' Or</i> was but a modest little establishment as
regarded the house, but it was surrounded on three sides by a
good-sized garden overlooking the river. Here, in the trellised
arbors which lined the lawn on either side, those customers who
preferred the open air could take their dinners, coffees, and
absinthes <i>al fresco</i>.</p>
<p>The scene when we arrived was at its gayest. There were dinners
going on in every arbor; waiters running distractedly to and fro
with trays and bottles; two women, one with a guitar, the other
with a tamborine, singing under a tree in the middle of the garden;
while in the air there reigned an exhilarating confusion of sounds
and smells impossible to describe.</p>
<p>We went in. M&uuml;ller paused, looked round, captured a passing
waiter, and asked for Monsieur le propri&eacute;taire. The waiter
pointed over his shoulder towards the house, and breathlessly
rushed on his way.</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller at once led the way into a salon on the ground-floor
looking over the garden.</p>
<p>Here we found ourselves in a large low room containing some
thirty or forty tables, and fitted up after the universal
restaurant pattern, with cheap-looking glasses, rows of hooks, and
spittoons in due number. The air was heavy with the combined smells
of many dinners, and noisy with the clatter of many tongues. Behind
the fruits, cigars, and liqueur bottles that decorated the
<i>comptoir</i> sat a plump, black-eyed little woman in a gorgeous
cap and a red silk dress. This lady welcomed us with a bewitching
smile and a gracious inclination of the head.</p>
<p>"<i>Ces messieurs</i>," she said, "will find a vacant table
yonder, by the window."</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller bowed majestically.</p>
<p>"Madame," he said, "I wish to see Monsieur le
propri&eacute;taire."</p>
<p>The dame de comptoir looked very uneasy.</p>
<p>"If Monsieur has any complaint to make," she said, "he can make
it to me."</p>
<p>"Madame, I have none."</p>
<p>"Or if it has reference to the ordering of a dinner...."</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller smiled loftily.</p>
<p>"Dinner, Madame," he said, with a disdainful gesture, "is but
one of the accidents common to humanity. A trifle! A trifle always
humiliating--sometimes inconvenient--occasionally impossible. No,
Madame, mine is a serious mission; a mission of the highest
importance, both socially and commercially. May I beg that you will
have the goodness to place my card in the hands of Monsieur le
propri&eacute;taire, and say that I request the honor of five
minutes' interview."</p>
<p>The little woman's eyes had all this time been getting rounder
and blacker. She was evidently confounded by my friend's
grandiloquence.</p>
<p>"<i>Ah! mon Dieu! M'sieur</i>," she said, nervously, "my husband
is in the kitchen. It is a busy day with us, you understand--but I
will send for him."</p>
<p>And she forthwith despatched a waiter for "Monsieur
Choucru."</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller seized me by the arm.</p>
<p>"Heavens!" he exclaimed, in a very audible aside, "did you hear?
She is his wife! She is Madame Choucru?"</p>
<p>"Well, and what of that?"</p>
<p>"What of that, indeed? <i>Mais, mon ami</i>, how can you ask the
question? Have you no eyes? Look at her! Such a remarkably handsome
woman--such a <i>tournure</i>--such eyes--such a figure for an
illustration! Only conceive the effect of Madame Choucru--in
medallion!"</p>
<p>"Oh, magnificent!" I replied. "Magnificent--in medallion."</p>
<p>But I could not, for the life of me, imagine what he was driving
at.</p>
<p>"And it would make the fortune of the <i>Toison d'Or</i>" he
added, solemnly.</p>
<p>To which I replied that it would undoubtedly do so.</p>
<p>Monsieur Choucru now came upon the scene; a short, rosy,
round-faced little man in a white flat cap and bibbed apron--like
an elderly cherub that had taken to cookery. He hung back upon the
threshold, wiping his forehead, and evidently unwilling to show
himself in his shirt-sleeves.</p>
<p>"Here, <i>mon bon</i>," cried Madame, who was by this time
crimson with gratified vanity, and in a fever of curiosity; "this
way--the gentleman is waiting to speak to you!"</p>
<p>Monsieur, the cook and proprietor, shuffled his feet to and fro
in the doorway, but came no nearer.</p>
<p>"<i>Parbleu</i>!" he said, "if M'sieur's business is not
urgent."</p>
<p>"It is extremely urgent, Monsieur Choucru," replied M&uuml;ller;
"and, moreover, it is not so much my business as it is yours,"</p>
<p>"Ah bah! if it is my business, then, it may stand over till
to-morrow," replied the little man, impatiently. "To-day I have
eighty dinners on hand, and with M'sieur's permission"....</p>
<p>But M&uuml;ller strode to the door and caught him by the
shoulder.</p>
<p>"No, Monsieur Choucru," he said sternly, "I will not let you
ruin yourself by putting off till to-morrow what can only be done
to-day. I have come here, Monsieur Choucru, to offer you fame. Fame
and fortune, Monsieur Choucru!--and I will not suffer you, for the
sake of a few miserable dinners, to turn your back upon the most
brilliant moment of your life!"</p>
<p>"<i>Mais, M'sieur</i>--explain yourself" ... stammered the
propri&eacute;taire.</p>
<p>"You know who I am, Monsieur Choucru?"</p>
<p>"No, M'sieur--not in the least."</p>
<p>"I am M&uuml;ller--Franz M&uuml;ller--landscape painter,
portrait painter, historical painter, caricaturist, artist <i>en
chef</i> to the <i>Petit Courier Illustr&eacute;</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Hein! M'sieur est peintre</i>!"</p>
<p>"Yes, Monsieur Choucru--and I offer you my protection."</p>
<p>Monsieur Choucru scratched his ear, and smiled doubtfully.</p>
<p>"Now listen, Monsieur Choucru--I am here to-day in the interests
of the <i>Petit Courier Illustr&eacute;</i>. I take the Courbevoie
f&ecirc;te for my subject. I sketch the river, the village, the
principal features of the-scene; and on Saturday my designs are in
the hands of all Paris. Do you understand me?"</p>
<p>"I understand that M'sieur is all this time talking to me of his
own business, while mine, <i>l&agrave; bas</i>, is standing still!"
exclaimed the propri&eacute;taire, in an agony of impatience. "I
have the honor to wish M'sieur good-day."</p>
<p>But M&uuml;ller seized him again, and would not let him
escape.</p>
<p>"Not so fast, Monsieur Choucru," he said; "not so fast! Will you
answer me one question before you go?"</p>
<p>"<i>Eh, mon Dieu</i>! Monsieur."</p>
<p>"Will you tell me, Monsieur Choucru, what is to prevent me from
giving a view of the best restaurant in Courbevoie?"</p>
<p>Madame Choucru, from behind the <i>comptoir</i>, uttered a
little scream.</p>
<p>"A design in the <i>Petit Courier Illustr&eacute;</i>, I need
scarcely tell you," pursued M&uuml;ller, with indescribable
pomposity, "is in itself sufficient to make the fortune not only of
an establishment, but of a neighborhood. I am about to make
Courbevoie the fashion. The sun of Asni&egrave;res, of Montmorency,
of Enghien has set--the sun of Courbevoie is about to rise. My
sketches will produce an unheard-of effect. All Paris will throng
to your f&ecirc;tes next Sunday and Monday--all Paris, with its
inexhaustible appetite for <i>bifteck aux pommes frites</i>--all
Paris with its unquenchable thirst for absinthe and Bavarian beer!
Now, Monsieur Choucru, do you begin to understand me?"</p>
<p>"<i>Mais</i>, Monsieur, I--I think...."</p>
<p>"You think you do, Monsieur Choucru? Very good. Then will you
please to answer me one more question. What is to prevent me from
conferring fame, fortune, and other benefits too numerous to
mention on your excellent neighbor at the corner of the
Place--Monsieur Coquille of the Restaurant <i>Croix de
Malte</i>?"</p>
<p>Monsieur Choucru scratched his ear again, stared helplessly at
his wife, and said nothing. Madame looked grave.</p>
<p>"Are we to treat this matter on the footing of a business
transaction, Monsieur!" she asked, somewhat sharply. "Because, if
so, let Monsieur at once name his price for me...."</p>
<p>"'PRICE,' Madame!" interrupted M&uuml;ller, with a start of
horror. "Gracious powers! this to me--to Franz M&uuml;ller of the
<i>Petit Courier Illustr&eacute;</i>! 'No, Madame--you mistake
me--you wound me--you touch the honor of the Fine Arts! Madame, I
am incapable of selling my patronage."</p>
<p>Madame clasped her hands; raised her voice; rolled her black
eyes; did everything but burst into tears. She was shocked to have
offended Monsieur! She was profoundly desolated! She implored a
thousand pardons! And then, like a true French-woman of business,
she brought back the conversation to the one important
point:--since money was not in question, upon what consideration
would Monsieur accord his preference to the <i>Toison d' Or</i>
instead of to the <i>Croix de Malte</i>?</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller bowed, laid his hand upon his heart, and said:--</p>
<p>"I will do it, <i>pour les beaux yeux de Madame</i>."</p>
<p>And then, in graceful recognition of the little man's rights as
owner of the eyes in question, he bowed to Monsieur Choucru.</p>
<p>Madame was inexpressibly charmed. Monsieur smiled, fidgeted, and
cast longing glances towards the door.</p>
<p>"I have eighty dinners on hand," he began again, "and if M'sieur
will excuse me...."</p>
<p>"One moment more, my dear Monsieur Choucru," said M&uuml;ller,
slipping his hand affectionately through the little man's arm. "For
myself, as I have already told you, I can accept nothing--but I am
bound in honor not to neglect the interests of the journal I
represent. You will of course wish to express your sense of the
compliment paid to your house by adding your name to the
subscription list of the <i>Petit Courier Illustr&eacute;</i>?"</p>
<p>"Oh, by--by all means--with pleasure," faltered the
propri&eacute;taire.</p>
<p>"For how many copies, Monsieur Choucru? Shall we say--six?"</p>
<p>Monsieur looked at Madame. Madame nodded. M&uuml;ller took out
his pocket-book, and waited, pencil in hand.</p>
<p>"Eh--<i>parbleu</i>!--let it be for six, then," said Monsieur
Choucru, somewhat reluctantly.</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller made the entry, shut up the pocket-book, and shook
hands boisterously with his victim.</p>
<p>"My dear Monsieur Choucru," he said, "I cannot tell you how
gratifying this is to my feelings, or with what disinterested
satisfaction I shall make your establishment known to the Parisian
public. You shall be immortalized, my dear fellow--positively
immortalized!"</p>
<p>"<i>Bien oblig&eacute;, M'sieur--bien oblig&eacute;</i>. Will
you not let my wife offer you a glass of liqueure?"</p>
<p>"Liqueure, <i>mon cher</i>!" exclaimed M&uuml;ller, with an
outburst of frank cordiality--"hang liqueure!--WE'LL DINE WITH
YOU!"</p>
<p>"Monsieur shall be heartily welcome to the best dinner the
<i>Toison d'Or</i> can send up; and his friend also," said Madame,
with her sweetest smile.</p>
<p>"Ah, Madame!"</p>
<p>"And M'sieur Choucru shall make you one of his famous cheese
souffl&eacute;s. <i>Tiens, mon bon</i>, go down and prepare a
cheese souffl&eacute; for two."</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller smote his forehead distractedly.</p>
<p>"For two!" he cried. "Heavens! I had forgotten my aunt and my
cousin!"</p>
<p>Madame looked up inquiringly.</p>
<p>"Monsieur has forgotten something?"</p>
<p>"Two somethings, Madame--two somebodies! My aunt--my excellent
and admirable maternal aunt,--and my cousin. We left them sitting
under a tree by the river-side, more than half an hour ago. But the
fault, Madame, is yours."</p>
<p>"How, Monsieur?"</p>
<p>"Yes; for in your charming society I forget the ties of family
and the laws of politeness. But I hasten to fetch my forgotten
relatives. With what pleasure they will share your amiable
hospitality! <i>Au revoir</i>, Madame. In ten minutes we shall be
with you again!"</p>
<p>Madame Choucru looked grave. She had not bargained to entertain
a party of four; yet she dared not disoblige the <i>Petit Courier
Illustr&eacute;</i>. She had no time, however, to demur to the
arrangement; for M&uuml;ller, ingeniously taking her acquiescence
for granted, darted out of the room without waiting for an
answer.</p>
<p>"Miserable man!" I exclaimed, as soon as we were outside the
doors, "what will you do now?"</p>
<p>"Do! Why, fetch my admirable maternal aunt and my interesting
cousin, to be sure."</p>
<p>"But you have raised a dinner under false pretences!"</p>
<p>"I, <i>mon cher</i>? Not a bit of it."</p>
<p>"Have you, then, really anything to do with the <i>Petit Courier
Illustr&eacute;</i>?"</p>
<p>"The Editor of the <i>Petit Courier Illustr&eacute;</i> is one
of the best fellows in the world, and occasionally (when my pockets
represent that vacuum which Nature very properly abhors) he
advances me a couple of Napoleons. I wipe out the score from time
to time by furnishing a design for the paper. Now to-day, you see,
I'm in luck. I shall pay off two obligations at once--to say
nothing of Monsieur Choucru's six-fold subscription to the P.C., on
which the publishers will allow me a douceur of thirty francs. Now,
confess that I'm a man of genius!"</p>
<p>In less than a quarter of an hour we were all four established
round one of Madame Choucru's comfortable little dining-tables, in
a snug recess at the farthest end of the salon. Here, being well
out of reach of our hostess's black eyes, M&uuml;ller assumed all
the airs of a liberal entertainer. He hung up <i>ma cousine's</i>
bonnet; fetched a footstool for <i>ma tante</i>; criticised the
sauces; presided over the wine; cut jokes with the waiter; and
pretended to have ordered every dish beforehand. The stewed kidneys
with mushrooms were provided especially for Madame Marotte; the
fricandeau was selected in honor of Mam'selle Marie (had he not an
innate presentiment that she loved fricandeau?); and as for the
soles <i>au gratin</i>, he swore, in defiance of probability and
all the laws of nature, that they were the very fish we had just
caught in the Seine. By-and-by came Monsieur Choucru's famous
cheese <i>souffl&eacute;</i>; and then, with a dish of fruit, four
cups of coffee, and four glasses of liqueure, the banquet came to
an end.</p>
<p>As we sat at desert, M&uuml;ller pulled out his book and
pencilled a rapid but flattering sketch of the dining-room
interior, developing a perspective as long as the Rue de Rivoli,
and a <i>mobilier</i> at least equal in splendor to that of the
<i>Trois Fr&egrave;res</i>.</p>
<p>At sight of this <i>chef d'oeuvre</i>, Madame Choucru was moved
almost to tears. Ah, Heaven! if Monsieur could only figure to
himself her admiration for his <i>beau talent</i>! But alas! that
was impossible--as impossible as that Monsieur Choucru should ever
repay this unheard-of obligation!</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller laid his hand upon his heart, and bowed
profoundly.</p>
<p>"Ah! Madame," he said, "it is not to Monsieur Choucru that I
look for repayment--it is to you."</p>
<p>"To me, Monsieur? <i>Dieu merci! Monsieur se moque de
moi</i>!"</p>
<p>And the Dame de Comptoir, intrenched behind her fruits and
liqueure bottles, shot a Parthian glance from under her black
eye-lashes, and made believe to blush.</p>
<p>"Yes, Madame, to you. I only ask permission to come again very
soon, for the purpose of executing a little portrait of Madame--a
little portrait which, alas! <i>must</i> fail to render adequate
justice to such a multitude of charms."</p>
<p>And with this choice compliment, M&uuml;ller bowed again, took
his leave, bestowed a whole franc upon the astonished waiter, and
departed from the <i>Toison d'Or</i> in an atmosphere of glory.</p>
<p>The fair, or rather that part of the fair where the dancers and
diners most did congregate, was all ablaze with lights, and noisy
with brass bands as we came out. <i>Ma tante</i>, who was somewhat
tired, and had been dozing for the last half hour over her coffee
and liqueure, was impatient to get back to Paris. The fair Marie,
who was not tired at all, confessed that she should enjoy a waltz
above everything. While M&uuml;ller, who professed to be an
animated time-table, swore that we were just too late for the ten
minutes past ten train, and that there would be no other before
eleven forty-five. So Madame Marotte was carried off, <i>bon
gr&eacute;, mal gr&eacute;</i>, to a dancing-booth, where gentlemen
were admitted on payment of forty centimes per head, and ladies
went in free.</p>
<p>Here, despite the noise, the dust, the braying of an abominable
band, the overwhelming smell of lamp-oil, and the clatter, not only
of heavy walking-boots, but even of several pairs of sabots upon an
uneven floor of loosely-joined planks--<i>ma tante</i>, being
disposed of in a safe corner, went soundly to sleep.</p>
<p>It was a large booth, somewhat over-full; and the company
consisted mainly of Parisian blue blouses, little foot-soldiers,
grisettes (for there were grisettes in those days, and plenty of
them), with a sprinkling of farm-boys and dairy-maids from the
villages round about. We found this select society caracoling round
the booth in a thundering galop, on first going in. After the
galop, the conductor announced a <i>valse &agrave; deux temps</i>.
The band struck up--one--two--three. Away went some thirty
couples--away went M&uuml;ller and the fair Marie--and away went
the chronicler of this modest biography with a pretty little girl
in green boots who waltzed remarkably well, and who deserted him in
the middle of the dance for a hideous little French soldier about
four feet and a half high.</p>
<p>After this rebuff (having learned, notwithstanding my friend's
representations to the contrary, that a train ran from Courbevoie
to Paris every half-hour up till midnight) I slipped away, leaving
M&uuml;ller and <i>ma cousine</i> in the midst of a furious
flirtation, and Madame Marotte fast asleep in her corner.</p>
<p>The clocks were just striking twelve as I passed under the
archway leading to the Cit&eacute; Berg&egrave;re.</p>
<p>"<i>Tiens</i>!" said the fat concierge, as she gave me my key
and my candle. "Monsieur has perhaps been to the theatre this
evening? No!--to the country--to the f&ecirc;te at Courbevoie! Ah,
then, I'll be sworn that M'sieur has had plenty of fun!"</p>
<p>But had I had plenty of fun? That was the question. That
M&uuml;ller had had plenty of flirting and plenty of fun was a fact
beyond the reach of doubt. But a flirtation, after all, unless in a
one-act comedy, is not entertaining to the mere looker-on; and oh!
must not those bridesmaids who sometimes accompany a happy couple
in their wedding-tour, have a dreary time of it?</p>

<h3>THE &Eacute;COLE DE NATATION.</h3>
<br>
<p>It seemed to me that I had but just closed my eyes, when I was
waked by a hand upon my shoulder, and a voice calling me by my
name. I started up to find the early sunshine pouring in at the
window, and Franz M&uuml;ller standing by my bedside.</p>
<p>"<i>Tiens</i>!" said he. "How lovely are the slumbers of
innocence! I was hesitating, <i>mon cher</i>, whether to wake or
sketch you."</p>
<p>I muttered something between a growl and a yawn, to the effect
that I should have been better satisfied if he had left me
alone.</p>
<p>"You prefer everything that is basely self-indulgent, young
man," replied M&uuml;ller, making a divan of my bed, and coolly
lighting his pipe under my very nose. "Contrary to all the laws of
<i>bon-camaraderie</i>, you stole away last night, leaving your
unprotected friend in the hands of the enemy. And for what?--for
the sake of a few hours' ignominious oblivion! Look at me--I have
not been to bed all night, and I am as lively as a lobster in a
lobster-pot."</p>
<p>"How did you get home?" I asked, rubbing my eyes; "and
when?"</p>
<p>"I have not got home at all yet," replied my visitor. "I have
come to breakfast with you first."</p>
<p>Just at this moment, the <i>pendule</i> in the adjoining room
struck six.</p>
<p>"To breakfast!" I repeated. "At this hour?--you who never
breakfast before midday!"</p>
<p>"True, <i>mon cher</i>; but then you see there are reasons. In
the first place, we danced a little too long, and missed the last
train, so I was obliged to bring the dear creatures back to Paris
in a fiacre. In the second place, the driver was drunk, and the
horse was groggy, and the fiacre was in the last stage of
dilapidation. The powers below only know how many hours we were on
the road; for we all fell asleep, driver included, and never woke
till we found ourselves at the Barri&egrave;re de l'&Eacute;toile
at the dawn of day."</p>
<p>"Then what have you done with Madame Marotte and Mademoiselle
Marie?"</p>
<p>"Deposited them at their own door in the Rue du Faubourg St.
Denis, as was the bounden duty of a <i>preux chevalier</i>. But
then, <i>mon cher</i>, I had no money; and having no money, I
couldn't pay for the fiacre; so I drove on here--and here I am--and
number One Thousand and Eleven is now at the door, waiting to be
paid."</p>
<p>"The deuce he is!"</p>
<p>"So you see, sad as it was to disturb the slumbers of innocence,
I couldn't possibly let you go on sleeping at the rate of two
francs an hour."</p>
<p>"And what is the rate at which you have waked me?"</p>
<p>"Sixteen francs the fare, and something for the driver--say
twenty in all."</p>
<p>"Then, my dear fellow, just open my desk and take one of the two
Napoleons you will see lying inside, and dismiss number One
Thousand and Eleven without loss of time; and then...."</p>
<p>"A thousand thanks! And then what?"</p>
<p>"Will you accept a word of sound advice?"</p>
<p>"Depends on whether it's pleasant to follow, <i>caro
mio</i>"</p>
<p>"Go home; get three or four hours' rest; and meet me in the
Palais Royal about twelve for breakfast."</p>
<p>"In order that you may turn round and go to sleep again in
comfort? No, young man, I will do nothing of the kind. You shall
get up, instead, and we'll go down to Molino's."</p>
<p>"To Molino's?"</p>
<p>"Yes--don't you know Molino's--the large swimming-school by the
Pont Neuf. It's a glorious morning for a plunge in the Seine."</p>
<p>A plunge in the Seine! Now, given a warm bed, a chilly autumn
morning, and a decided inclination to quote the words of the
sluggard, and "slumber again," could any proposition be more
inopportune, savage, and alarming? I shuddered; I protested; I
resisted; but in vain.</p>
<p>"I shall be up again in less time than it will take you to tell
your beads, <i>mon gaillard</i>" said M&uuml;ller the ferocious,
as, having captured my Napoleon, he prepared to go down and
liquidate with number One Thousand and Eleven. "And it's of no use
to bolt me out, because I shall hammer away till you let me in, and
that will wake your fellow-lodgers. So let me find you up, and
ready for the fray."</p>
<p>And then, execrating M&uuml;ller, and Molino, and Molino's bath,
and Molino's customers, and all Molino's ancestors from the period
of the deluge downwards, I reluctantly complied.</p>
<p>The air was brisk, the sky cloudless, the sun coldly bright; and
the city wore that strange, breathless, magical look so peculiar to
Paris at early morning. The shops were closed; the pavements
deserted; the busy thoroughfares silent as the avenues of
P&egrave;re la Chaise. Yet how different from the early stillness
of London! London, before the world is up and stirring, looks dead,
and sullen, and melancholy; but Paris lies all beautiful, and
bright, and mysterious, with a look as of dawning smiles upon her
face; and we know that she will wake presently, like the Sleeping
Beauty, to sudden joyousness and activity.</p>
<p>Our road lay for a little way along the Boulevards, then down
the Rue Vivienne, and through the Palais Royal to the quays; but
long ere we came within sight of the river this magical calm had
begun to break up. The shop-boys in the Palais Royal were already
taking down the shutters--the great book-stall at the end of the
Galerie Vitr&eacute;e showed signs of wakefulness; and in the Place
du Louvre there was already a detachment of brisk little
foot-soldiers at drill. By the time we had reached the open line of
the quays, the first omnibuses were on the road; the water-carriers
were driving their carts and blowing their shrill little bugles;
the washer-women, hard at work in their gay, oriental-looking
floating kiosques, were hammering away, mallet in hand, and
chattering like millions of magpies; and the early matin-bell was
ringing to prayers as we passed the doors of St. Germain
L'Auxerrois.</p>
<p>And now we were skirting the Quai de l'&Eacute;cole, looking
down upon the bath known in those days as Molino's--a hugh,
floating quadrangular structure, surrounded by trellised arcades
and rows of dressing-rooms, with a divan, a caf&eacute; restaurant,
and a permanent corps of cooks and hair-dressers on the
establishment. For your true Parisian has ever been wedded to his
Seine, as the Venetian to his Adriatic; and the &Eacute;cole de
Natation was then, as now, a lounge, a reading-room, an adjunct of
the clubs, and one of the great institutions of the capital.</p>
<p>Some bathers, earlier than ourselves, were already sauntering
about the galleries in every variety of undress, from the simple
<i>cale&ccedil;on</i> to the gaudiest version of Turkish robe and
Algerian <i>kepi</i>. Some were smoking; some reading the morning
papers; some chatting in little knots; but as yet, with the
exception of two or three school-boys (called, in the <i>argot</i>
of the bath, <i>moutards</i>), there were no swimmers in the
water.</p>
<p>With some of these loungers M&uuml;ller exchanged a nod or a few
words as we passed along the platform; but shook hands cordially
with a bronzed, stalwart man, dressed like a Venetian gondolier in
the frontispiece to a popular ballad, with white trousers, blue
jacket, anchor buttons, red sash, gold ear-rings, and great silver
buckles in his shoes. M&uuml;ller introduced this romantic-looking
person to me as "Monsieur Barbet."</p>
<p>"My friend, Monsieur Barbet," said he, "is the prince of
swimming-masters. He is more at home in the water than on land, and
knows more about swimming than a fish. He will calculate you the
specific gravity of the heaviest German metaphysician at a glance,
and is capable of floating even the works of Monsieur Thiers, if
put to the test."</p>
<p>"Monsieur can swim?" said the master, addressing me, with a
nautical scrape.</p>
<p>"I think so," I replied.</p>
<p>"Many gentlemen think so," said Monsieur Barbet, "till they find
themselves in the water."</p>
<p>"And many who wish to be thought accomplished swimmers never
venture into it on that account," added M&uuml;ller. "You would
scarcely suppose," he continued, turning to me, "that there are men
here--regular <i>habitu&eacute;s</i> of the bath--who never go into
the water, and yet give themselves all the airs of practised
bathers. That tall man, for instance, with the black beard and
striped <i>peignoir</i>, yonder--there's a fellow who comes once or
twice a week all through the season, goes through the ceremony of
undressing, smokes, gossips, criticises, is looked up to as an
authority, and has never yet been seen off the platform. Then
there's that bald man in the white robe--his name's Giroflet--a
retired stockbroker. Well, that fellow robes himself like an
ancient Roman, puts himself in classical attitudes, affects
taciturnity, models himself upon Brutus, and all that sort of
thing; but is as careful not to get his feet wet as a cat. Others,
again, come simply to feed. The restaurant is one of the choicest
in Paris, with this advantage over V&eacute;four or the Trois
Fr&egrave;res, that it is the only place where you may eat and
drink of the best in hot weather, with nothing on but the briefest
of <i>cale&ccedil;ons</i>"</p>
<p>Thus chattering, M&uuml;ller took me the tour of the bath, which
now began to fill rapidly. We then took possession of two little
dressing-rooms no bigger than sentry-boxes, and were presently in
the water.</p>
<p>The scene now became very animated. Hundreds of eccentric
figures crowded the galleries--some absurdly fat, some ludicrously
thin; some old, some young; some bow-legged, some knock-kneed; some
short, some tall; some brown, some yellow; some got up for effect
in gorgeous wrappers; and all more or less hideous.</p>
<p>"An amusing sight, isn't it?" said M&uuml;ller, as, having swum
several times round the bath, we sat down for a few moments on one
of the flights of steps leading down to the water.</p>
<p>"It is a sight to disgust one for ever with human-kind," I
replied.</p>
<p>"And to fill one with the profoundest respect for one's tailor.
After all, it's broad-cloth makes the man."</p>
<p>"But these are not men--they are caricatures."</p>
<p>"Every man is a caricature of himself when you strip him," said
M&uuml;ller, epigrammatically. "Look at that scarecrow just
opposite. He passes for an Adonis, <i>de par le monde</i>."</p>
<p>I looked and recognised the Count de Rivarol, a tall young man,
an <i>&eacute;l&eacute;gant</i> of the first water, a curled
darling of society, a professed lady-killer, whom I had met many a
time in attendance on Madame de Marignan. He now looked like a
monkey:--</p>
<blockquote>.... "long, and lank and brown,<br>
As in the ribb'd sea sand!"</blockquote>
<p>"Gracious heavens!" I exclaimed, "what would become of the
world, if clothes went out of fashion?"</p>
<p>"Humph!--one half of us, my dear fellow, would commit
suicide."</p>
<p>At the upper end of the bath was a semicircular platform
somewhat loftier than the rest, called the Amphitheatre. This, I
learned, was the place of honor. Here clustered the
<i>&eacute;lite</i> of the swimmers; here they discussed the great
principles of their art, and passed judgment on the performances of
those less skilful than themselves. To the right of the
Amphitheatre rose a slender spiral staircase, like an openwork
pillar of iron, with a tiny circular platform on the top, half
surrounded by a light iron rail. This conspicuous perch, like the
pillar of St. Simeon Stylites, was every now and then surmounted by
the gaunt figure of some ambitious plunger who, after
attitudinizing awhile in the pose of Napoleon on the column
Vend&ocirc;me, would join his hands above his head and take a
tremendous "header" into the gulf below. When this feat was
successfully performed, the <i>&eacute;lite</i> in the Amphitheatre
applauded graciously.</p>
<p>And now, what with swimming, and lounging, and looking on, some
two hours had slipped by, and we were both hungry and tired,
M&uuml;ller proposed that we should breakfast at the Caf&eacute;
Procope.</p>
<p>"But why not here?" I asked, as a delicious breeze from the
buffet came wafting by "like a steam of rich distilled
perfumes."</p>
<p>"Because a breakfast <i>chez</i> Molino costs at least
twenty-five francs per head--BECAUSE I have credit at
Procope--BECAUSE I have not a <i>sou</i> in my pocket--and BECAUSE,
milord Smithfield, I aspire to the honor of entertaining your
lordship on the present occasion!" replied M&uuml;ller, punctuating
each clause of his sentence with a bow.</p>
<p>If M&uuml;ller had not a <i>sou</i>, I, at all events, had now
only one Napoleon; so the Caf&eacute; Procope carried the day.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII."></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>
<h3>THE RUE DE L'ANCIENNE COM&Eacute;DIE AND THE CAF&Eacute;
PROCOPE.</h3>
<br>
<p>The Rue des Foss&eacute;s-Saint-Germain-des-Pr&egrave;s and the
Rue de l'Ancienne Com&eacute;die are one and the same. As the Rue
des Foss&eacute;s-Saint-Germain-des-Pr&egrave;s, it dates back to
somewhere about the reign of Philippe Auguste; and as the Rue de
l'Ancienne Com&egrave;die it takes its name and fame from the year
1689, when the old Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais was opened
on the 18th of April by the company known as Moli&ecirc;re's
troupe--Moli&ecirc;re being then dead, and Lully having succeeded
him at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre du Palais Royal.</p>
<p>In the same year, 1689, one Fran&ccedil;ois Procope, a Sicilian,
conceived the happy idea of hiring a house just opposite the new
theatre, and there opening a public refreshment-room, which at once
became famous, not only for the excellence of its coffee (then
newly introduced into France), but also for being the favorite
resort of all the wits, dramatists, and beaux of that brilliant
time. Here the latest epigrams were circulated, the newest scandals
discussed, the bitterest literary cabals set on foot. Here Jean
Jacques brooded over his chocolate; and Voltaire drank his mixed
with coffee; and Dorat wrote his love-letters to Mademoiselle
Saunier; and Marmontel wrote praises of Mademoiselle Clairon; and
the Marquis de Bi&eacute;vre made puns innumerable; and Duclos and
Mercier wrote satires, now almost forgotten; and Piron recited
those verses which are at once his shame and his fame; and the
Chevalier de St. Georges gave fencing lessons to his literary
friends; and Lamothe, Fr&eacute;ron, D'Alembert, Diderot,
Helvetius, and all that wonderful company of wits, philosophers,
encyclopaedists, and poets, that lit up as with a dying glory the
last decades of the old <i>r&eacute;gime</i>, met daily, nightly,
to write, to recite, to squabble, to lampoon, and some times to
fight.</p>
<p>The year 1770 beheld, in the closing of the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre
Fran&ccedil;ais, the extinction of a great power in the Rue des
Foss&eacute;s-Saint-Germain-des-Pr&egrave;s--for it was not, in
fact, till the theatre was no more a theatre that the street
changed its name, and became the Rue de L'Ancienne Com&eacute;die.
A new house (to be on first opening invested with the time-honored
title of Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais, but afterwards to be
known as the Od&eacute;on) was now in progress of erection in the
close neighborhood of the Luxembourg. The actors, meanwhile,
repaired to the little theatre of the Tuilleries. At length, in
1782,<a name="FNanchor2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2">[2]</a> the Rue
de L'Ancienne Com&eacute;die was one evening awakened from its two
years' lethargy by the echo of many footfalls, the glare of many
flambeaux, and the rattle of many wheels; for all Paris, all the
wits and critics of the Caf&eacute; Procope, all the fair
shepherdesses and all the beaux seigneurs of the court of Marie
Antoinette and Louis XVI., were hastening on foot, in chairs, and
in chariots, to the opening of the new house and the performance of
a new play! And what a play! Surely, not to consider it too
curiously, a play which struck, however sportively, the key-note of
the coming Revolution;--a play which, for the first time, displayed
society literally in a state of <i>bouleversement</i>;--a play in
which the greed of the courtier, the venality of the judge, the
empty glitter of the crown, were openly held up to scorn;--a play
in which all the wit, audacity, and success are on the side of the
<i>canaille</i>;--a play in which a lady's-maid is the heroine, and
a valet canes his master, and a great nobleman is tricked,
outwitted, and covered with ridicule!</p>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor2">[2]</a>
1782 is the date given by M. Hippolyte Lucas. Sainte-Beuve places
it two years later.</blockquote>
<p>This play, produced for the first time under the title of <i>La
Folle Journ&eacute;e</i>, was written by one Caron de
Beaumarchais--a man of wit, a man of letters, a man of the people,
a man of nothing--and was destined to achieve immortality under its
later title of <i>Le Mariage de Figaro</i>.</p>
<p>A few years later, and the Rue de l'Ancienne Com&eacute;die
echoed daily and nightly to the dull rumble of Revolutionary
tumbrils, and the heavy tramp of Revolutionary mobs. Danton and
Camille Desmoulins must have passed through it habitually on their
way to the Revolutionary Tribunal. Charlotte Corday (and this is a
matter of history) did pass through it that bright July evening,
1793, on her way to a certain gloomy house still to be seen in the
adjoining Rue de l'&Eacute;cole de M&eacute;decine, where she
stabbed Marat in his bath.</p>
<p>But throughout every vicissitude of time and politics, though
fashion deserted the Rue de l'Ancienne Com&eacute;die, and actors
migrated, and fresh generations of wits and philosophers succeeded
each other, the Caf&eacute; Procope still held its ground and
maintained its ancient reputation. The theatre (closed in less than
a century) became the studio first of Gros and then of
G&eacute;rard, and was finally occupied by a succession of
restaurateurs but the Caf&eacute; Procope remained the Caf&eacute;
Procope, and is the Caf&eacute; Procope to this day.</p>
<p>The old street and all belonging to it--especially and
peculiarly the Caf&eacute; Procope---was of the choicest Quartier
Latin flavor in the time of which I write; in the pleasant,
careless, impecunious days of my youth. A cheap and highly popular
restaurateur named Pinson rented the old theatre. A
<i>costumier</i> hung out wigs, and masks, and d&eacute;bardeur
garments next door to the restaurateur. Where the fatal tumbril
used to labor past, the frequent omnibus now rattled gayly by; and
the pavements trodden of old by Voltaire, and Beaumarchais, and
Charlotte Corday, were thronged by a merry tide of students and
grisettes. Meanwhile the Caf&eacute; Procope, though no longer the
resort of great wits and famous philosophers, received within its
hospitable doors, and nourished with its indifferent refreshments,
many a now celebrated author, painter, barrister, and statesman. It
was the general rendezvous for students of all kinds--poets of the
&Eacute;cole de Droit, philosophers of the &Eacute;cole de
M&eacute;decine, critics of the &Eacute;cole des Beaux Arts. It
must however be admitted that the poetry and criticism of these
future great men was somewhat too liberally perfumed with tobacco,
and that into their systems of philosophy there entered a
considerable element of grisette.</p>
<p>Such, at the time of my first introduction to it, was the famous
Caf&eacute; Procope.</p>
<br>

<br>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX."></a>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
<h3>THE PHILOSOPHY OF BREAKFAST.</h3>
<br>
<p>"Now this, <i>mon cher</i>," said M&uuml;ller, taking off his
hat with a flourish to the young lady at the <i>comptoir</i>, "is
the immortal Caf&eacute; Procope."</p>
<p>I looked round, and found myself in a dingy, ordinary sort of
Caf&eacute;, in no wise differing from any other dingy, ordinary
sort of Caf&eacute; in that part of Paris. The decorations were
ugly enough to be modern. The ceiling was as black with gas-fumes
and tobacco smoke as any other ceiling in any other estaminet in
the Quartier Latin. The waiters looked as waiters always look
before midday--sleepy, discontented, and unwashed. A few young men
of the regular student type were scattered about here and there at
various tables, reading, smoking, chatting, breakfasting, and
reading the morning papers. In an alcove at the upper end of the
second room (for there were two, one opening from the other) stood
a blackened, broken-nosed, plaster bust of Voltaire, upon the
summit of whose august wig some irreverent customer had perched a
particularly rakish-looking hat. Just in front of this alcove and
below the bust stood a marble-topped table, at one end of which two
young men were playing dominoes to the accompaniment of the
matutinal absinthe.</p>
<p>"And this," said M&uuml;ller, with another flourish, "is the
still more immortal table of the still more supremely immortal
Voltaire. Here he was wont to rest his sublime elbows and sip his
<i>demi-tasse</i>. Here, upon this very table, he wrote that famous
letter to Marie Antoinette that Fr&eacute;ron stole, and in revenge
for which he wrote the comedy called <i>l'Ecossaise</i>; but of
this admirable satire you English, who only know Voltaire in his
Henriade and his history of Charles the Twelfth, have probably
never heard till this moment! <i>Eh bien</i>! I'm not much wiser
than you--so never mind. I'll be hanged if I've ever read a line of
it. Anyhow, here is the table, and at this other end of it we'll
have our breakfast."</p>
<p>It was a large, old-fashioned, Louis Quatorze piece of
furniture, the top of which, formed from a single slab of some kind
of gray and yellow marble, was stained all over with the coffee,
wine, and ink-splashes of many generations of customers. It looked
as old--nay, older--than the house itself.</p>
<p>The young men who were playing at dominoes looked up and nodded,
as three or four others had done in the outer room when we passed
through.</p>
<p>"<i>Bonjour, l'ami</i>," said the one who seemed to be winning.
"Hast thou chanced to see anything of Martial, coming along!"</p>
<p>"I observed a nose defiling round the corner of the Rue de
Bussy," replied M&uuml;ller, "and it looked as if Martial might be
somewhere in the far distance, but I didn't wait to see. Are you
expecting him?"</p>
<p>"Confound him--yes! We've been waiting more than half an
hour."</p>
<p>"If you have invited him to breakfast," said M&uuml;ller, "he is
sure to come."</p>
<p>"On the contrary, he has invited us to breakfast."</p>
<p>"Ah, that alters the case," said M&uuml;ller, philosophically.
"Then he is sure <i>not</i> to come." "Gar&ccedil;on!"</p>
<p>A bullet-headed, short-jacketed, long-aproned waiter, who looked
as if he had not been to bed since his early youth, answered the
summons,</p>
<p>"M'sieur!"</p>
<p>"What have you that you can especially recommend this
morning?"</p>
<p>The waiter, with that nasal volubility peculiar to his race,
rapidly ran over the whole vegetable and animal creation.</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller listened with polite incredulity.</p>
<p>"Nothing else?" said he, when the other stopped, apparently from
want of breath.</p>
<p>"<i>Mais oui, M'sieur</i>!" and, thus stimulated, the waiter,
having "exhausted worlds and then imagined new," launched forth
into a second and still more impossible catalogue.</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller turned to me.</p>
<p>"The resources of this establishment, you observe," he said,
very gravely, "are inexhaustible. One might have a Roc's egg
&agrave; la Sindbad for the asking."</p>
<p>The waiter looked puzzled, shuffled his slippered feet, and
murmured something about "<i>oeufs sur le plat</i>."</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, however," continued M&uuml;ller, "we are but
men--not fortresses provisioning for a siege. Antoine, <i>mon
enfant</i>, we know thee to be a fellow of incontestible veracity,
and thy list is magnificent; but we will be content with a
<i>vol-au-vent</i> of fish, a <i>bifteck aux pommes frites</i>, an
<i>omelette sucr&eacute;e</i>, and a bottle of thy 1840 Bordeaux
with the yellow seal. Now vanish!"</p>
<p>The waiter, wearing an expression of intense relief, vanished
accordingly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile more students had come in, and more kept coming. Hats
and caps cropped up rapidly wherever there were pegs to hang them
on, and the talking became fast and furious.</p>
<p>I soon found that everybody knew everybody at the Caf&eacute;
Procope, and that the specialty of the establishment was
dominoes--just as the specialty of the Caf&eacute; de la
R&eacute;gence is chess. There were games going on before long at
almost every table, and groups of lookers-on gathered about those
who enjoyed the reputation of being skilful players.</p>
<p>Gradually breakfast after breakfast emerged from some mysterious
nether world known only to the waiters, and the war of dominoes
languished.</p>
<p>"These are all students, of course," I said presently, "and yet,
though I meet a couple of hundred fellows at our hospital lectures,
I don't see a face I know."</p>
<p>"You would find some by this time, I dare say, in the other
room," replied M&uuml;ller. "I brought you in here that you might
sit at Voltaire's table, and eat your steak under the shadow of
Voltaire's bust; but this salon is chiefly frequented by
law-students--the other by medical and art students. Your place,
<i>mon ch&eacute;r</i>, as well as mine, is in the outer
sanctuary."</p>
<p>"That infernal Martial!" groaned one of the domino-players at
the other end of the table. "So ends the seventh game, and here we
are still. <i>Parbleu!</i> Horace, hasn't that absinthe given you
an inconvenient amount of appetite?"</p>
<p>"Alas! my friend--don't mention it. And when the absinthe is
paid for, I haven't a sou."</p>
<p>"My own case precisely. What's to be done?"</p>
<p>"Done!" echoed Horace, pathetically. "Shade of Apicius! inspire
me...but, no--he's not listening."</p>
<p>"Hold! I have it. We'll make our wills in one another's favor,
and die."</p>
<p>"I should prefer to die when the wind is due East, and the moon
at the full," said Horace, contemplatively.</p>
<p>"True--besides, there is still <i>la m&egrave;re</i> Gaudissart.
Her cutlets are tough, but her heart is tender. She would not
surely refuse to add one more breakfast to the score!"</p>
<p>Horace shook his head with an air of great despondency.</p>
<p>"There was but one Job," said he, "and he has been dead some
time. The patience of <i>la m&egrave;re</i> Gaudissart has long
since been entirely exhausted."</p>
<p>"I am not so sure of that. One might appeal to her feelings, you
know--have a presentiment of early death--wipe away a tear... Bah!
it is worth the effort, anyhow."</p>
<p>"It is a forlorn hope, my dear fellow, but, as you say, it is
worth the effort. <i>Allons donc!</i> to the storming of <i>la
m&egrave;re</i> Gaudissart!"</p>
<p>And with this they pushed aside the dominoes, took down their
hats, nodded to M&uuml;ller, and went out.</p>
<p>"There go two of the brightest fellows and most improvident
scamps in the whole Quartier," said my companion. "They are both
studying for the bar; both under age; both younger sons of good
families; and both destined, if I am not much mistaken, to rise to
eminence by-and-by. Horace writes for <i>Figaro</i> and the
<i>Petit Journal pour Rire</i>--Th&eacute;ophile does
<i>feuilleton</i> work--romances, chit-chat, and political
squibs--rubbish, of course; but clever rubbish, and wonderful when
one considers what boys they both are, and what dissipated lives
they lead. The amount of impecuniosity those fellows get through in
the course of a term is something inconceivable. They have often
only one decent suit between them--and sometimes not that. To-day,
you see, they are at their wits' end for a breakfast. They have run
their credit dry at Procope and everywhere else, and are gone now
to a miserable little den in the Rue du Paon, kept by a fat
good-natured old soul called <i>la m&egrave;re</i> Gaudissart. She
will perhaps take compassion on their youth and inexperience, and
let them have six sous worth of horsebeef soup, stale bread, and
the day before yesterday's vegetables. Nay, don't look so pitiful!
We poor devils of the Student Quartier hug our Bohemian life, and
exalt it above every other. When we have money, we cannot find
windows enough out of which to fling it--when we have none, we
start upon <i>la chasse au diner</i>, and enjoy the pleasures of
the chase. We revel in the extremes of fasting and feasting, and
scarcely know which we prefer."</p>
<p>"I think your friends Horace and Th&eacute;ophile are tolerably
clear as to which <i>they</i> prefer," I remarked, with a
smile.</p>
<p>"Bah! they would die of <i>ennui</i> if they had always enough
to eat! Think how it sharpens a man's wits if--given the time, the
place, and the appetite--he has every day to find the credit for
his dinners! Show me a mathematical problem to compare with it as a
popular educator of youth!"</p>
<p>"But for young men of genius, like Horace and
Th&eacute;ophile..."</p>
<p>"Make yourself quite easy, <i>mon cher</i>. A little privation
will do them no kind of harm. They belong to that class of whom it
has been said that 'they would borrow money from Harpagon, and find
truffles on the raft of the Medusa.' But hold! we are at the end of
our breakfast. What say you? Shall we take our <i>demi-tasse</i> in
the next room, among our fellow-students of physic and the fine
arts?"</p>

<h3>A MAN WITH A HISTORY.</h3>
<br>
<p>The society of the outer salon differed essentially from the
society of the inner salon at the Caf&eacute; Procope. It was
noisier--it was shabbier--it was smokier. The conversation in the
inner salon was of a general character on the whole, and, as one
caught sentences of it here and there, seemed for the most part to
relate to the literature and news of the day--to the last important
paper in the Revue des Deux Mondes, to the new drama at the
Od&eacute;on, or to the article on foreign politics in the
<i>Journal des D&eacute;bats</i>. But in the outer salon the talk
was to the last degree shoppy, and overflowed with the argot of the
studios. Some few medical students were clustered, it is true, in a
corner near the door; but they were so outnumbered by the artists
at the upper end of the room, that these latter seemed to hold
complete possession, and behaved more like the members of a
recognised club than the casual customers of a caf&eacute;. They
talked from table to table. They called the waiters by their
Christian names. They swaggered up and down the middle of the room
with their hats on their heads, their hands in their pockets, and
their pipes in their mouths, as coolly as if it were the broad walk
of the Luxembourg gardens.</p>
<p>And the appearance of these gentlemen was not less remarkable
than their deportment. Their hair, their beards, their clothes,
were of the wildest devising. They seemed one and all to have
started from a central idea, that central idea being to look as
unlike their fellow-men as possible; and thence to have diverged
into a variety that was nothing short of infinite. Each man had
evidently modelled himself upon his own ideal, and no two ideals
were alike. Some were picturesque, some were grotesque; and some,
it must be admitted, were rather dirty ideals, into the realization
of which no such paltry considerations as those of soap, water, or
brushes were permitted to enter.</p>
<p>Here, for instance, were Roundhead crops and flowing locks of
Cavalier redundancy--steeple-crowned hats, and Roman cloaks draped
bandit-fashion--moustachios frizzed and brushed up the wrong way in
the style of Louis XIV.--pointed beards and slouched hats, after
the manner of Vandyke---patriarchal beards <i>&agrave; la
Barbarossa</i>--open collars, smooth chins, and long undulating
locks of the Raffaelle type--coats, blouses, paletots of
inconceivable cut, and all kinds of unusual colors--in a word,
every eccentricity of clothing, short of fancy costume, in which it
was practicable for men of the nineteenth century to walk abroad
and meet the light of day.</p>
<p>We had no sooner entered this salon, taken possession of a
vacant table, and called for coffee, than my companion was beset by
a storm of greetings.</p>
<p>"Hol&agrave;! M&uuml;ller, where hast thou been hiding these
last few centuries, <i>mon gaillard?</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Tiens!</i> M&uuml;ller risen from the dead!"</p>
<p>"What news from <i>l&agrave; bas,</i> old fellow?"</p>
<p>To all which ingenious pleasantries my companion replied in
kind--introducing me at the same time to two or three of the
nearest speakers. One of these, a dark young man got up in the
style of a Byzantine Christ, with straight hair parted down the
middle, a bifurcated beard, and a bare throat, was called
Eug&egrave;ne Droz. Another--big, burly, warm-complexioned, with
bright open blue eyes, curling reddish beard and moustache,
slouched hat, black velvet blouse, immaculate linen, and an
abundance of rings, chains, and ornaments--was made up in excellent
imitation of the well-known portrait of Rubens. This gentleman's
name, as I presently learned, was Caesar de Lepany.</p>
<p>When we came in, these two young men, Droz and De Lepany, were
discussing, in enthusiastic but somewhat unintelligible language,
the merits of a certain Monsieur Lemonnier, of whom, although till
that moment ignorant of his name and fame, I at once perceived that
he must be some celebrated <i>chef de cuisine</i>.</p>
<p>"He will never surpass that last thing of his," said the
Byzantine youth. "Heavens! How smooth it is! How buttery! How
pulpy!"</p>
<p>"Ay--and yet with all that lusciousness of quality, he never
wants piquancy," added De Lepany.</p>
<p>"I think his greens are apt to be a little raw," interposed
M&uuml;ller, taking part in the conversation.</p>
<p>"Raw!" echoed the first speaker, indignantly. "<i>Eh, mon
Dieu!</i> What can you be thinking of! They are almost too
hot!"</p>
<p>"But they were not so always, Eug&egrave;ne," said he of the
Rubens make-up, with an air of reluctant candor. "It must be
admitted that Lemonnier's greens used formerly to be a trifle--just
a trifle--raw. Evidently Monsieur M&uuml;ller does not know how
much he has taken to warming them up of late. Even now, perhaps,
his olives are a little cold."</p>
<p>"But then, how juicy his oranges are!" exclaimed young
Byzantine.</p>
<p>"True--and when you remember that he never washes--!"</p>
<p>"Ah, <i>sacredie!</i> yes--there is the marvel!"</p>
<p>And Monsieur Eug&egrave;ne Droz held up his hands and eyes with
all the reverent admiration of a true believer for a particularly
dirty dervish.</p>
<p>"Who, in Heaven's name, is this unclean individual who used to
like his vegetables underdone, and never washes?" whispered I in
M&uuml;ller's ear.</p>
<p>"What--Lemonnier! You don't mean to say you never heard of
Lemonnier?"</p>
<p>"Never, till now. Is he a cook?"</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller gave me a dig in the ribs that took my breath
away.</p>
<p>"<i>Goguenard!</i>" said he. "Lemonnier's an artist--the
foremost man of the water-color school. But I wouldn't be too funny
if I were you. Suppose you were to burst your jocular vein--there'd
be a catastrophe!"</p>
<p>Meanwhile the conversation of Messieurs Droz and Lepany had
taken a fresh turn, and attracted a little circle of listeners,
among whom I observed an eccentric-looking young man with a
club-foot, an enormously long neck, and a head of short, stiff,
dusty hair, like the bristles of a blacking-brush.</p>
<p>"Queroulet!" said Lepany, with a contemptuous flourish of his
pipe. "Who spoke of Queroulet? Bah!--a miserable plodder, destitute
of ideality--a fellow who paints only what he sees, and sees only
what is commonplace--a dull, narrow-souled, unimaginative
handicraftsman, to whom a tree is just a tree; and a man, a man;
and a straw, a straw, and nothing more!"</p>
<p>"That's a very low-souled view to take of art, no doubt,"
croaked in a grating treble voice the youth with the club-foot;
"but if trees and men and straws are not exactly trees and men and
straws, and are not to be represented as trees and men and straws,
may I inquire what else they are, and how they are to be
pictorially treated?"</p>
<p>"They must be ideally treated, Monsieur Valentin," replied
Lepany, majestically.</p>
<p>"No doubt; but what will they be like when they are ideally
treated? Will they still, to the vulgar eye, be recognisable for
trees and men and straws?"</p>
<p>"I should scarcely have supposed that Monsieur Valentin would
jest upon such a subject as a canon of the art he professes," said
Lepany, becoming more and more dignified.</p>
<p>"I am not jesting," croaked Monsieur Valentin; "but when I hear
men of your school talk so much about the Ideal, I (as a realist)
always want to know what they themselves understand by the
phrase."</p>
<p>"Are you asking me for my definition of the Ideal, Monsieur
Valentin?"</p>
<p>"Well, if it's not giving you too much trouble--yes."</p>
<p>Lepany, who evidently relished every chance of showing off, fell
into a picturesque attitude and prepared to hold forth. Valentin
winked at one or two of his own clique, and lit a cigar.</p>
<p>"You ask me," began Lepany, "to define the Ideal--in other
words, to define the indefinite, which alas! whether from a
metaphysical, a philosophical, or an aesthetic point of view, is a
task transcending immeasurably my circumscribed powers of
expression."</p>
<p>"Gracious heavens!" whispered M&uuml;ller in my ear. "He must
have been reared from infancy on words of five syllables!"</p>
<p>"What shall I say?" pursued Lepany. "Shall I say that the Ideal
is, as it were, the Real distilled and sublimated in the alembic of
the imagination? Shall I say that the Ideal is an image projected
by the soul of genius upon the background of the universe? That it
is that dazzling, that unimaginable, that incommunicable goal
towards which the suns in their orbits, the stars in their courses,
the spheres with all their harmonies, have been chaotically tending
since time began! Ideal, say you? Call it ideal, soul, mind,
matter, art, eternity,... what are they all but words? What are
words but the weak strivings of the fettered soul that fain would
soar to those empyrean heights where Truth, and Art, and Beauty are
one and indivisible? Shall I say all this..."</p>
<p>"My dear fellow, you have said it already--you needn't say it
again," interrupted Valentin.</p>
<p>"Ay; but having said it--having expressed myself, perchance with
some obscurity...."</p>
<p>"With the obscurity of Erebus!" said, very deliberately, a fat
student in a blouse.</p>
<p>"Monsieur!" exclaimed De Lepany, measuring the length and
breadth of the fat student with a glance of withering scorn.</p>
<p>The Byzantine was no less indignant.</p>
<p>"Don't heed them, <i>mon ami</i>!" he cried, enthusiastically.
"Thy definition is sublime-eloquent!"</p>
<p>"Nay," said Valentin, "we concede that Monsieur de Lepany is
sublime; we recognise with admiration that he is eloquent; but we
submit that he is wholly unintelligible."</p>
<p>And having delivered this parting shot, the club-footed realist
slipped his arm through the arm of the fat student, and went off to
a distant table and a game at dominoes.</p>
<p>Then followed an outburst of offended idealism. His own clique
crowded round Lepany as the champion of their school. They shook
hands with him. They embraced him. They fooled him to the top of
his bent. Presently, being not only as good-natured as he was
conceited, but (rare phenomenon in the Quartier Latin!) a rich
fellow into the bargain, De Lepany called for champagne and treated
his admirers all around.</p>
<p>In the midst of the chatter and bustle which this incident
occasioned, a pale, earnest-looking man of about five-and-thirty,
coming past our table on his way out of the Caf&eacute;, touched
M&uuml;ller on the arm, bent down, and said quietly:--</p>
<p>"M&uuml;ller, will you do me a favor!"</p>
<p>"A hundred, Monsieur," replied my companion; half rising, and
with an air of unusual respect and alacrity.</p>
<p>"Thanks, one will be enough. Do you see that man yonder, sitting
alone in the corner, with his back to the light?"</p>
<p>"I do."</p>
<p>"Good--don't look at him again, for fear of attracting his
attention. I have been trying for the last half hour to get a
sketch of his head, but I think he suspected me. Anyhow he moved so
often, and so hid his face with his hands and the newspaper, that I
was completely baffled. Now it is a remarkable head--just the head
I have been wanting for my Marshal Romero--and if, with your rapid
pencil and your skill in seizing expression, you could manage this
for me...."</p>
<p>"I will do my best," said M&uuml;ller.</p>
<p>"A thousand thanks. I will go now; for when I am gone he will be
off his guard. You will find me in the den up to three o'clock.
Adieu."</p>
<p>Saying which, the stranger passed on, and went out.</p>
<p>"That's Flandrin!" said M&uuml;ller.</p>
<p>"Really?" I said. "Flandrin! And you know him?"</p>
<p>But in truth I only answered thus to cover my own ignorance; for
I knew little at that time of modern French art, and I had never
even heard the name of Flandrin before.</p>
<p>"Know him!" echoed M&uuml;ller. "I should think so. Why, I
worked in his studio for nearly two years."</p>
<p>And then he explained to me that this great painter (great even
then, though as yet appreciated only in certain choice Parisian
circles, and not known out of France) was at work upon a grand
historical subject connected with the Spanish persecutions in the
Netherlands--the execution of Egmont and Horn, in short, in the
great square before the H&ocirc;tel de Ville in Brussels.</p>
<p>"But the main point now," said M&uuml;ller, "is to get the
sketch--and how? Confound the fellow! while he keeps his back to
the light and his head down like that, the thing is impossible.
Anyhow I can't do it without an accomplice. You must help me."</p>
<p>"I! What can I do?"</p>
<p>"Go and sit near him--speak to him--make him look up--keep him,
if possible, for a few minutes in conversation--nothing
easier."</p>
<p>"Nothing easier, perhaps, if I were you; but, being only myself,
few things more difficult!"</p>
<p>"Nevertheless, my dear boy, you must try, and at once. Hey
--presto!--away!"</p>
<p>Placed where we were, the stranger was not likely to have
observed us; for we had come into the room from behind the corner
in which he was sitting, and had taken our places at a table which
he could not have seen without shifting his own position. So, thus
peremptorily commanded, I rose; slipped quietly back into the inner
salon, made a pretext of looking at the clock over the door; and
came out again, as if alone and looking for a vacant seat.</p>
<p>The table at which he had placed himself was very small--only
just big enough to stand in a corner and hold a plate and a
coffee-cup; but it was supposed to be large enough for two, and
there were evidently two chairs belonging to it. On one of these,
being alone, the stranger had placed his overcoat and a small black
bag. I at once saw and seized my opportunity.</p>
<p>"Pardon, Monsieur," I said, very civilly, "will you permit me to
hang these things up?"</p>
<p>He looked up, frowned, and said abruptly:--</p>
<p>"Why, Monsieur?"</p>
<p>"That I may occupy this chair."</p>
<p>He glanced round; saw that there was really no other vacant;
swept off the bag and coat with his own hands; hung them on a peg
overhead; dropped back into his former attitude, and went on
reading.</p>
<p>"I regret to have given you the trouble, Monsieur," I said,
hoping to pave the way to a conversation.</p>
<p>But a little quick, impatient movement of the hand was his only
reply. He did not even raise his head. He did not even lift his
eyes from the paper.</p>
<p>I called for a demi-tasse and a cigar; then took out a note-book
and pencil, assumed an air of profound abstraction, and affected to
become absorbed in calculations.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, I could not resist furtively observing the
appearance of this man whom a great artist had selected as his
model for one of the darkest characters of medi&aelig;val
history.</p>
<p>He was rather below than above the middle height; spare and
sinewy; square in the shoulders and deep in the chest; with
close-clipped hair and beard; grizzled moustache; high cheek-bones;
stern impassive features, sharply cut; and deep-set restless eyes,
quick and glancing as the eyes of a monkey. His face, throat, and
hands were sunburnt to a deep copper-color, as if cast in bronze.
His age might have been from forty-five to fifty. He wore a
thread-bare frock-coat buttoned to the chin; a stiff black stock
revealing no glimpse of shirt-collar; a well-worn hat pulled low
over his eyes; and trousers of dark blue cloth, worn very white and
shiny at the knees, and strapped tightly down over a pair of
much-mended boots.</p>
<p>The more I looked at him, the less I was surprised that Flandrin
should have been struck by his appearance. There was an air of
stern poverty and iron resolution about the man that arrested one's
attention at first sight. The words "<i>ancien militaire"</i> were
written in every furrow of his face; in every seam and on every
button of his shabby clothing. That he had seen service, missed
promotion, suffered unmerited neglect (or, it might be, merited
disgrace), seemed also not unlikely.</p>
<p>Watching him as he sat, half turned away, half hidden by the
newspaper he was reading, one elbow resting on the table, one
brown, sinewy hand supporting his chin and partly concealing his
mouth, I told myself that here, at all events, was a man with a
history--perhaps with a very dark history. What were the secrets of
his past? What had he done? What had he endured? I would give much
to know.</p>
<p>My coffee and cigar being brought, I asked for the
<i>Figaro</i>, and holding the paper somewhat between the stranger
and myself, watched him with increasing interest.</p>
<p>I now began to suspect that he was less interested in his own
newspaper than he appeared to be, and that his profound
abstraction, like my own, was assumed. An indefinable something in
the turn of his head seemed to tell me that his attention was
divided between whatever might be going forward in the room and
what he was reading. I cannot describe what that something was; but
it gave me the impression that he was always listening. When the
outer door opened or shut, he stirred uneasily, and once or twice
looked sharply round to see what new-comer entered the caf&eacute;.
Was he anxiously expecting some one who did not come? Or was he
dreading the appearance of some one whom he wished to avoid? Might
he not be a political refugee? Might he not be a spy?</p>
<p>"There is nothing of interest in the papers to-day, Monsieur,"
said, making another effort to force him into conversation.</p>
<p>He affected not to hear me.</p>
<p>I drew my chair a little nearer, and repeated the
observation.</p>
<p>He frowned impatiently, and without looking up, replied:--</p>
<p>"<i>Eh, mon Dieu</i>, Monsieur!--when there is a dearth of
news!"</p>
<p>"There need not, even so, be a dearth of wit. <i>Figaro</i> is
as heavy to-day as a government leader in the <i>Moniteur</i>."</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders and moved slightly round, apparently
to get a better light upon what he was reading, but in reality to
turn still more away from me. The gesture of avoidance was so
marked, that with the best will in the world, it would have been
impossible for me to address him again. I therefore relapsed into
silence.</p>
<p>Presently I saw a sudden change flash over him.</p>
<p>Now, in turning away from myself, he had faced round towards a
narrow looking-glass panel which reflected part of the opposite
side of the room; and chancing, I suppose, to lift his eyes from
the paper, he had seen something that arrested his attention. His
head was still bent; but I could see that his eyes were riveted
upon the mirror. There was alertness in the tightening of his hand
before his mouth--in the suspension of his breathing.</p>
<p>Then he rose abruptly, brushed past me as if I were not there,
and crossed to where M&uuml;ller, sketch-book in hand, was in the
very act of taking his portrait.</p>
<p>I jumped up, almost involuntarily, and followed him.
M&uuml;ller, with an unsuccessful effort to conceal his confusion,
thrust the book into his pocket.</p>
<p>"Monsieur," said the stranger, in a low, resolute voice, "I
protest against what you have been doing. You have no right to take
my likeness without my permission."</p>
<p>"Pardon, Monsieur, I--I beg to assure you--" stammered
M&uuml;ller.</p>
<p>"That you intended no offence? I am willing to suppose so. Give
me up the sketch, and I am content."</p>
<p>"Give up the sketch!" echoed M&uuml;ller.</p>
<p>"Precisely, Monsieur."</p>
<p>"Nay--but if, as an artist, I have observed that which leads me
to desire a--a memorandum--let us say of the pose and contour of a
certain head," replied M&uuml;ller, recovering his self-possession,
"it is not likely that I shall be disposed to part from my
memorandum."</p>
<p>"How, Monsieur! you refuse?"</p>
<p>"I am infinitely sorry, but--"</p>
<p>"But you refuse?"</p>
<p>"I certainly cannot comply with Monsieur's request."</p>
<p>The stranger, for all his bronzing, grew pale with rage.</p>
<p>"Do not compel me, Monsieur, to say what I must think of your
conduct, if you persist in this determination," he said
fiercely.</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller smiled, but made no reply.</p>
<p>"You absolutely refuse to yield up the sketch?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely."</p>
<p>"Then, Monsieur, <i>c'est une infamie</i>--<i>et vous &ecirc;tes
un l&acirc;che</i>!"</p>
<p>But the last word had scarcely hissed past his lips before
M&uuml;ller dashed his coffee dregs full in the stranger's
face.</p>
<p>In one second, the table was upset--blows were
exchanged--M&uuml;ller, pinned against the wall with his
adversary's hands upon his throat, was striking out with the
desperation of a man whose strength is overmatched--and the whole
room was in a tumult.</p>
<p>In vain I attempted to fling myself between them. In vain the
waiters rushed to and fro, imploring "ces Messieurs" to interpose.
In vain a stout man pushed his way through the bystanders,
exclaiming angrily:--</p>
<p>"Desist, Messieurs! Desist, in the name of the law! I am the
proprietor of this establishment--I forbid this brawling--I will
have you both arrested! Messieurs, do you hear?"</p>
<p>Suddenly the flush of rage faded out of M&uuml;ller's face. He
gasped--became livid. Lepany, Droz, myself, and one or two others,
flew at the stranger and dragged him forcibly back.</p>
<p>"Assassin!" I cried, "would you murder him?"</p>
<p>He flung us off, as a baited bull flings off a pack of curs. For
myself, though I received only a backhanded blow on the chest, I
staggered as if I had been struck with a sledgehammer.</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller, half-fainting, dropped into a chair.</p>
<p>There was a tramp and clatter at the door--a swaying and parting
of the crowd.</p>
<p>"Here are the sergents de ville!" cried a trembling waiter.</p>
<p>"He attacked me first," gasped M&uuml;ller. "He has half
strangled me."</p>
<p>"<i>Qu'est ce que &ccedil;a me fait</i>!" shouted the enraged
proprietor. "You are a couple of <i>canaille</i>! You have made a
scandal in my Caf&eacute;. Sergents, arrest both these
gentlemen!"</p>
<p>The police--there were two of them, with their big cocked hats
on their heads and their long sabres by their sides--pushed through
the circle of spectators. The first laid his hand on M&uuml;ller's
shoulder; the second was about to lay his hand on mine, but I drew
back.</p>
<p>"Which is the other?" said he, looking round.</p>
<p>"<i>Sacredie</i>!" stammered the proprietor, "he was
here--there--not a moment ago!"</p>
<p>"<i>Diable</i>!" said the sergent de ville, stroking his
moustache, and staring fiercely about him. "Did no one see him
go?"</p>
<p>There was a chorus of exclamations--a rush to the inner
salon--to the door--to the street. But the stranger was nowhere in
sight; and, which was still more incomprehensible, no one had seen
him go!</p>
<p>"<i>Mais, mon Dieu</i>!" exclaimed the proprietor, mopping his
head and face violently with his pocket-handkerchief, "was the man
a ghost, that he should vanish into the air?"</p>
<p>"<i>Parbleu</i>! a ghost with muscles of iron," said
M&uuml;ller. "Talk of the strength of a madman--he has the strength
of a whole lunatic asylum!"</p>
<p>"He gave me a most confounded blow in the ribs, anyhow!" said
Lepany.</p>
<p>"And nearly broke my arm," added Eug&egrave;ne Droz.</p>
<p>"And has given me a pain in my chest for a week," said I, in
chorus.</p>
<p>"If he wasn't a ghost," observed the fat student sententiously,
"he must certainly be the devil."</p>
<p>The sergents de ville grinned.</p>
<p>"Do we, then, arrest this gentleman?" asked the taller and
bigger of the two, his hand still upon my friend's shoulder.</p>
<p>But M&uuml;ller laughed and shook his head.</p>
<p>"What!" said he, "arrest a man for resisting the devil?
Nonsense, <i>mes amis</i>, you ought to canonize me. What says
Monsieur le propri&eacute;taire?"</p>
<p>Monsieur the proprietor smiled.</p>
<p>"I am willing to let the matter drop," he replied, "on the
understanding that Monsieur M&uuml;ller was not really the first
offender."</p>
<p>"<i>Foi d'honneur</i>! He insulted me--I threw some coffee in
his face--he flung himself upon me like a tiger, and almost choked
me, as all here witnessed. And for what? Because I did him the
honor to make a rough pencilling of his ugly face &nbsp;...
<i>Mille tonnerres</i>!--the fellow has stolen my sketch-book!"</p>

<h3>FANCIES ABOUT FACES.</h3>
<br>
<p>The sketch-book was undoubtedly gone, and the stranger had
undoubtedly taken it. How he took it, and how he vanished, remained
a mystery.</p>
<p>The aspect of affairs, meanwhile, was materially changed.
M&uuml;ller no longer stood in the position of a leniently-treated
offender. He had become accuser, and plaintiff. A grave breach of
the law had been committed, and he was the victim of a bold and
skilful <i>tour de main</i>.</p>
<p>The police shook their heads, twirled their moustaches, and
looked wise.</p>
<p>It was a case of premeditated assault--in short, of robbery with
violence. It must be inquired into--reported, of course, at
head-quarters, without loss of time. Would Monsieur be pleased to
describe the stolen sketch-book? An oblong, green volume, secured
by an elastic band; contains sketches in pencil and water-colors;
value uncertain--Good. And the accused ... would Monsieur also be
pleased to describe the person of the accused? His probable age,
for instance; his height; the color of his hair, eyes, and beard?
Good again. Lastly, Monsieur's own name and address, exactly and in
full. <i>Tr&egrave;s-bon.</i> It might, perhaps, be necessary for
Monsieur to enter a formal deposition to-morrow morning at the
Prefecture of Police, in which case due notice would be given.</p>
<p>Whereupon he who seemed to be chief of the twain, having entered
M&uuml;ller's replies in a greasy pocket-book of stupendous
dimensions, which he seemed to wear like a cuirass under the breast
of his uniform, proceeded to interrogate the proprietor and
waiters.</p>
<p>Was the accused an habitual frequenter of the cafe?--No. Did
they remember ever to have seen him there before?--No. Should they
recognise him if they saw him again? To this question the answers
were doubtful. One waiter thought he should recognise the man;
another was not sure; and Monsieur the proprietor admitted that he
had himself been too angry to observe anything or anybody very
minutely.</p>
<p>Finally, having made themselves of as much importance and asked
as many questions as possible, the sergents de ville condescended
to accept a couple of-petits verres a-piece, and then, with much
lifting of cocked hats and clattering of sabres, departed.</p>
<p>Most of the students had ere this dropped off by twos and
threes, and were gone to their day's work, or pleasure--to return
again in equal force about five in the afternoon. Of those that
remained, some five or six came up when the police were gone, and
began chatting about the robbery. When they learned that Flandrin
had desired to have a sketch of the man's head; when M&uuml;ller
described his features, and I his obstinate reserve and
semi-military air, their excitement knew no bounds. Each had
immediately his own conjecture to offer. He was a political spy,
and therefore fearful lest his portrait should be recognised. He
was a conspirator of the Fieschi school. He was Mazzini in
person.</p>
<p>In the midst of the discussion, a sudden recollection flashed
upon me.</p>
<p>"A clue! a clue!" I shouted triumphantly. "He left his coat and
black bag hanging up in the corner!"</p>
<p>Followed by the others, I ran to the spot where I had been
sitting before the affray began. But my exultation was shortlived.
Coat and bag, like their owner, had disappeared.</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller thrust his hands into his pockets, shook his head,
and whistled dismally.</p>
<p>"I shall never see my sketch-book again, <i>parbleu!</i>" said
he. "The man who could not only take it out of my breast-pocket,
but also in the very teeth of the police, secure his property and
escape unseen, is a master of his profession. Our friends in the
cocked hats have no chance against him."</p>
<p>"And Flandrin, who is expecting the sketch," said I; "what of
him?"</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>"Next to being beaten," growled he, "there's nothing I hate like
confessing it. However, it has to be done--so the sooner the
better. Would you like to come with me? You'll see his studio."</p>
<p>I was only too glad to accompany him; for to me, as to most of
us, there was ever a nameless charm in the picturesque litter of an
artist's studio. M&uuml;ller's own studio, however, was as yet the
only one I had seen. He laughed when I said this.</p>
<p>"If your only notion of a studio is derived from that specimen,"
said he, "you will he agreeably surprised by the contrast. He calls
his place a 'den,' but that's a metaphor. Mine is a howling
wilderness."</p>
<p>Arriving presently at a large house at the bottom of a courtyard
in the Rue Vaugirard, he knocked at a small side-door bearing a
tiny brass plate not much larger than a visiting-card, on which was
engraved--"Monsieur Flandrin."</p>
<p>The door opened by some invisible means from within, and we
entered a passage dimly lighted by a painted glass door at the
farther end. My companion led the way down this passage, through
the door, and into a small garden containing some three or four old
trees, a rustic seat, a sun-dial on an antique-looking fragment of
a broken column, and a little weed-grown pond about the size of an
ordinary drawing-room table, surrounded by artificial
rock-work.</p>
<p>At the farther extremity of this garden, filling the whole space
from wall to wall, and occupying as much ground as must have been
equal to half the original enclosure, stood a large, new,
windowless building, in shape exactly like a barn, lighted from a
huge skylight in the roof, and entered by a small door in one
corner. I did not need to be told that this was the studio.</p>
<p>But if the outside was like a barn, the inside was like a
beautiful medi&aelig;val interior by Cattermole--an interior
abounding in rich and costly detail; in heavy crimson draperies,
precious old Italian cabinets, damascened armor, carved chairs with
upright backs and twisted legs, old paintings in massive Florentine
frames, and strange quaint pieces of Elizabethan furniture, like
buffets, with open shelves full of rare and artistic
things--bronzes, ivory carvings, unwieldy Majolica jars, and lovely
goblets of antique Venetian glass laced with spiral ornaments of
blue and crimson and that dark emerald green of which the secret is
now lost for ever.</p>
<p>Then, besides all these things, there were great folios leaning
piled against the walls, one over the other; and Persian rugs of
many colors lying here and there about the floor; and down in one
corner I observed a heap of little models, useful, no doubt, as
accessories in pictures--gondolas, frigates, foreign-looking carts,
a tiny sedan chair, and the like.</p>
<p>But the main interest of the scene concentrated itself in the
unfinished picture, the hired model (a brawny fellow in a
close-fitting suit of black, leaning on a huge two-handed sword),
and the artist in his holland blouse, with the palette and brushes
in his hand.</p>
<p>It was a very large picture, and stood on a monster easel,
somewhat towards the end of the studio. The light from above poured
full upon the canvas, while beyond lay a background of shadow. Much
of the subject was as yet only indicated, but enough was already
there to tell the tragic story and display the power of the
painter. There, high above the heads of the mounted guards and the
assembled spectators, rose the scaffold, hung with black. Egmont,
wearing a crimson tabard, a short black cloak embroidered with
gold, and a hat ornamented with black and white plumes, stood in a
haughty attitude, as if facing the square and the people. Two other
figures, apparently of an ecclesiastic and a Spanish general,
partly in outline, partly laid in with flat color, were placed to
the right of the principal character. The headsman stood behind,
leaning upon his sword. The slender spire of the H&ocirc;tel de
Ville, surmounted by its gilded archangel glittering in the morning
sun, rose high against a sky of cloudless blue; while all around
was seen the well-known square with its sculptured gables and
decorated fa&ccedil;ades--every roof, window, and balcony crowded
with spectators.</p>
<p>Unfinished though it was, I saw at once that I was brought face
to face with what would some day be a famous work of art. The
figures were grandly grouped; the heads were noble; the sky was
full of air; the action of the whole scene informed with life and
motion.</p>
<p>I stood admiring and silent, while M&uuml;ller told his tale,
and Flandrin paused in his work to listen.</p>
<p>"It is horribly unlucky," said he. "I had not been able to find
a portrait of Romero and, <i>faute de mieux</i>, have been trying
for days past to invent the right sort of head for him--of course,
without success. You never saw such a heap of failures! But as for
that man at the caf&eacute;, if Providence had especially created
him for my purpose, he could not have answered it better."</p>
<p>"I believe I am as sorry as you can possibly be," said
M&uuml;ller.</p>
<p>"Then you are very sorry indeed," replied the painter; and he
looked even more disappointment than he expressed.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid I can't do it," said M&uuml;ller, after a moment's
silence; "but if you'll give me a pencil and a piece of paper, and
credit me with the will in default of the deed, I will try to
sketch the head from memory."</p>
<p>"Ah? if you can only do that! Here is a drawing block--choose
what pencils you prefer--or here are crayons, if you like them
better."</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller took the pencils and block, perched himself on the
corner of a table, and began. Flandrin, breathless with
expectation, looked over his shoulder. Even the model (in the grim
character of Egmont's executioner) laid aside his two-handed sword,
and came round for a peep.</p>
<p>"Bravo! that's just his nose and brow," said Flandrin, as
M&uuml;ller's rapid hand flew over the paper. "Yes--the likeness
comes with every touch ... and the eyes, so keen and furtive.
&nbsp;... Nay, that eyelid should be a little more depressed at
the<br>
corner.... Yes, yes--just so. Admirable! There!--don't attempt to
work it up. The least thing might mar the likeness. My dear fellow,
what a service you have rendered me!"</p>
<p>"<i>Quatre-vingt mille diables</i>!" ejaculated the model, his
eyes riveted upon the sketch.</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller laughed and looked.</p>
<p>"<i>Tiens</i>! Guichet," said he, "is that meant for a
compliment?"</p>
<p>"Where did you see him?" asked the model, pointing down at the
sketch.</p>
<p>"Why? Do you know him?"</p>
<p>"Where did you see him, I say?" repeated Guichet,
impatiently.</p>
<p>He was a rough fellow, and garnished every other sentence with
an oath; but he did not mean to be uncivil.</p>
<p>"At the Caf&eacute; Procope."</p>
<p>"When?"</p>
<p>"About an hour ago. But again, I repeat--do you know him?"</p>
<p>"Do I know him? <i>Tonnerre de Dieu</i>!"</p>
<p>"Then who and what is he?"</p>
<p>The model stroked his beard; shook his head; declined to
answer.</p>
<p>"Bah!" said he, gloomily, "I may have seen him, or I may be
mistaken. 'Tis not my affair."</p>
<p>"I suspect Guichet knows something against this interesting
stranger," laughed Flandrin. "Come, Guichet, out with it! We are
among friends."</p>
<p>But Guichet again looked at the drawing, and again shook his
head.</p>
<p>"I'm no judge of pictures, messieurs," said he. "I'm only a poor
devil of a model. How can I pretend to know a man from such a
<i>griffonage</i> as that?"</p>
<p>And, taking up his big sword again, he retreated to his former
post over against the picture. We all saw that he was resolved to
say no more.</p>
<p>Flandrin, delighted with M&uuml;ller's sketch, put it, with many
thanks and praises, carefully away in one of the great folios
against the wall.</p>
<p>"You have no idea, <i>mon cher</i> M&uuml;ller," he said, "of
what value it is to me. I was in despair about the thing till I saw
that fellow this morning in the Caf&eacute;; and he looked as if he
had stepped out of the Middle Ages on purpose for me. It is quite a
medi&aelig;val face--if you know what I mean by a medi&aelig;val
face."</p>
<p>"I think I do," said M&uuml;ller. "You mean that there was a
moyen-&acirc;ge type, as there was a classical type, and as there
is a modern type."</p>
<p>"Just so; and therein lies the main difficulty that we
historical painters have to encounter. When we cannot find
portraits of our characters, we are driven to invent faces for
them--and who can invent what he never sees? Invention must be
based on some kind of experience; and to study old portraits is not
enough for our purpose, except we frankly make use of them as
portraits. We cannot generalize upon them, so as to resuscitate a
vanished type."</p>
<p>"But then has it really vanished?" said M&uuml;ller. "And how
can we know for certain that the medi&aelig;val type did actually
differ from the type we see before us every day?"</p>
<p>"By simple and direct proof--by studying the epochs of portrait
painting. Take Holbein's heads, for instance. Were not the people
of his time grimmer, harder-visaged, altogether more unbeautiful
than the people of ours? Take Petitot's and Sir Peter Lely's. Can
you doubt that the characteristics of their period were entirely
different? Do you suppose that either race would look as we look,
if resuscitated and clothed in the fashion of to-day?"</p>
<p>"I am not at all sure that we should observe any difference,"
said M&uuml;ller, doubtfully.</p>
<p>"And I feel sure we should observe the greatest," replied
Flandrin, striding up and down the studio, and speaking with great
animation. "I believe, as regards the men and women of Holbein's
time, that their faces were more lined than ours; their eyes, as a
rule, smaller--their mouths wider--their eyebrows more
scanty--their ears larger--their figures more ungainly. And in like
manner, I believe the men and women of the seventeenth century to
have been more fleshy than either Holbein's people or ourselves; to
have had rounder cheeks, eyes more prominent and heavy-lidded,
shorter noses, more prominent chins, and lips of a fuller and more
voluptuous mould."</p>
<p>"Still we can't be certain how much of all this may be owing to
the mere mannerisms of successive schools of art," urged
M&uuml;ller, sticking manfully to his own opinion. "Where will you
find a more decided mannerist than Holbein? And because he was the
first portrait-painter of his day, was he not reproduced with all
his faults of literalness and dryness by a legion of imitators? So
with Sir Peter Lely, with Petitot, with Vandyck, with every great
artist who painted kings and queens and court beauties. Then,
again, a certain style of beauty becomes the rage, and-a skilful
painter flatters each fair sitter in turn by bringing up her
features, or her expression, or the color of her hair, as near as
possible to the fashionable standard. And further, there is the
dress of a period to be taken into account. Think of the family
likeness that pervades the flowing wigs of the courts of Louis
Quatorze and Charles the Second--see what powder did a hundred
years ago to equalize mankind."</p>
<p>Flandrin shook his head.</p>
<p>"Ingenious, <i>mon gar&ccedil;on</i>" said he; "ingenious, but
unsound The cut of a fair lady's bodice never yet altered the shape
of her nose; neither was it the fashion of their furred surtouts
that made Erasmus and Sir Thomas More as like as twins. What you
call the 'mannerism' of Holbein is only his way of looking at his
fellow-creatures. He and Sir Antonio More were the most faithful of
portrait-painters. They didn't know how to flatter. They painted
exactly what they saw--no more, and no less; so that every head
they have left us is a chapter in the history of the Middle Ages.
The race--depend on't--the race was unbeautiful; and not even the
picturesque dress of the period (which, according to your theory,
should have helped to make the wearers of it more attractive) could
soften one jot of their plainness."</p>
<p>"I can't bring myself to believe that we were all so
ugly--French, English, and Germans alike--only a couple of
centuries ago," said M&uuml;ller.</p>
<p>"That is to say, you prefer to believe that Holbein, and Lucas
Cranach, and Sir Antonio More, and all their school, were
mannerists. Nonsense, my dear fellow--nonsense! <i>It is Nature who
is the mannerist</i>. She loves to turn out a certain generation
after a particular pattern; and when she is tired of that pattern,
she invents another. Her fancies last, on the average about, a
hundred years. Sometimes she changes the type quite abruptly;
sometimes modifies it by gentle, yet always perceptible, degrees.
And who shall say what her secret processes are? Education, travel,
intermarriage with foreigners, the introduction of new kinds of
food) the adoption of new habits, may each and all have something
to do with these successive changes; but of one point at least we
may be certain--and that is, that we painters are not responsible
for her caprices. Our mission is to interpret Dame Nature more or
less faithfully, according to our powers; but beyond interpretation
we cannot go. And now (for you know I am as full of speculations as
an experimental philosopher) I will tell you another conclusion I
have come to with regard to this subject; and that is that national
types were less distinctive in medi&aelig;val times than in ours.
The French, English, Flemish, and Dutch of the Middle Ages, as we
see them in their portraits, are curiously alike in all outward
characteristics. The courtiers of Francis the First and their
(James, and the lords and ladies of the court of Henry the Eighth,
resemble each other as people of one nation. Their features are, as
it were, cast in one mould. So also with the courts of Louis
Quatorze and Charles the Second. As for the regular French face of
to-day, with its broad cheek-bones and high temples running far up
into the hair on either side, that type does not make its
appearance till close upon the advent of the Reign of Terror. But
enough! I shall weary you with theories, and wear out the patience
of our friend Guichet, who is sufficiently tired already with
waiting for a head that never comes to be cut off as it ought.
Adieu--adieu. Come soon again, and see how I get on with Marshal
Romero."</p>
<p>Thus dismissed, we took our leave and left the painter to his
work.</p>
<p>"An extraordinary man!" said M&uuml;ller, as we passed out again
through the neglected garden and paused for a moment to look at
some half-dozen fat gold and silver fish that were swimming lazily
about the little pond. "A man made up of contradictions--abounding
in energy, yet at the same time the dreamiest of speculators. An
original thinker, too; but wanting that basis which alone makes
original thinking of any permanent value."</p>
<p>"But," said I, "he is evidently an educated man."</p>
<p>"Yes--educated as most artists are educated; but Flandrin has as
strong a bent for science as for art, and deserved something
better. Five years at a German university would have made of him
one of the most remarkable men of his time. What did you think of
his theory of faces?"</p>
<p>"I know nothing of the subject, and cannot form a judgment; but
it sounded as if it might be true."</p>
<p>"Yes--just that. It may be true, and it may not. If true, then
for my own part I should like to pursue his theory a step further,
and trace the operation of these secret processes by means of which
I am, happily, such a much better-looking fellow than my
great-great-great-great-grandfather of two hundred years ago. What,
for instance, has the introduction of the potato done for the noses
of mankind?"</p>
<p>Chatting thus, we walked back as far as the corner of the Rue
Racine, where we parted; I to attend a lecture at the &Eacute;cole
de M&eacute;decine, and M&uuml;ller to go home to his studio in the
Rue Clovis.</p>

<h3>RETURNED WITH THANKS.</h3>
<br>
<p>A week or two had thus gone by since the dreadful evening at the
Op&eacute;ra Comique, and all this time I had neither seen nor
heard more of the fair Josephine. My acquaintance with Franz
M&uuml;ller and the life of the Quartier Latin had, on the
contrary, progressed rapidly. Just as the affair of the Opera had
dealt a final blow to my romance <i>&agrave; la grisette</i> on the
one hand, so had the excursion to Courbevoie, the visit to the
&Eacute;cole de Natation, and the adventure of the Caf&eacute;
Procope, fostered my intimacy with the artist on the other. We were
both young, somewhat short of money, and brimful of fun. Each, too,
had a certain substratum of earnestness underlying the mere
surface-gayety of his character. M&uuml;ller was enthusiastic for
art; I for poetry; and both for liberty. I fear, when I look back
upon them, that we talked a deal of nonsense about Brutus, and the
Rights of Man, and the noble savage, and all that sort of thing, in
those hot-headed days of our youth. It was a form of political
measles that the young men of that time were quite as liable to as
the young men of our own; and, living as we then were in the heart
of the most revolutionary city in Europe, I do not well see how we
could have escaped the infection. M&uuml;ller (who took it worse
than I did, and was very rabid indeed when I first knew him)
belonged just then not only to the honorable brotherhood of Les
Chicards, but also to a small debating club that met twice a week
in a private room at the back of an obscure Estaminet in the Rue de
la Harpe. The members of this club were mostly art-students, and
some, like himself, Chicards--generous, turbulent, high-spirited
boys, with more enthusiasm than brains, and a flow of words wholly
out of proportion to the bulk of their ideas. As I came to know him
more intimately, I used sometimes to go there with M&uuml;ller,
after our cheap dinner in the Quartier and our evening stroll along
the Boulevards or the Champs Elys&eacute;es; and I am bound to
admit that I never, before or since, heard quite so much nonsense
of the declamatory sort as on those memorable occasions. I did not
think it nonsense then, however. I admired it with all my heart;
applauded the nursery eloquence of these sucking Mirabeaus and
Camille Desmoulins as frantically as their own vanity could desire;
and was even secretly chagrined that my own French was not yet
fluent enough to enable me to take part in their discussions.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, my debts were paid; and, having dropped out of
society when I fell out of love with Madame de Marignan, I no
longer overspent my allowance. I bought no more bouquets, paid for
no more opera-stalls, and hired no more prancing steeds at seven
francs the hour. I bade adieu to picture-galleries, flower-shows,
morning concerts, dress boots, white kid gloves, elaborate
shirt-fronts, and all the vanities of the fashionable world. In a
word, I renounced the Faubourg St. Germain for the Quartier Latin,
and applied myself to such work and such pleasures as pertained to
the locality. If, after a long day at Dr. Ch&eacute;ron's, or the
H&ocirc;tel Dieu, or the &Eacute;cole de M&eacute;decine, I did
waste a few hours now and then, I, at least, wasted them cheaply.
Cheaply, but oh, so pleasantly! Ah me! those nights at the debating
club, those evenings at the Chicards, those student's balls at the
Chaumi&egrave;re, those third-class trips to Versailles and
Fontainebleau, those one-franc pit seats at the Ga&icirc;et&eacute;
and the Palais Royal, those little suppers at Pompon's and
Flicoteau's--how delightful they were! How joyous! How free from
care! And even when we made up a party and treated the ladies (for
to treat the ladies is <i>de rigueur</i> in the code of Quartier
Latin etiquette), how little it still cost, and what a world of
merriment we had for the money!</p>
<p>It was well for me, too, and a source of much inward
satisfaction, that my love-affair with Mademoiselle Josephine had
faded and died a natural death. We never made up that quarrel of
the Op&eacute;ra Comique, and I had not desired that we should make
it up. On the contrary, I was exceedingly glad of the opportunity
of withdrawing my attentions; so I wrote her a polite little note,
in which I expressed my regret that our tastes were so dissimilar
and our paths in life so far apart; wished her every happiness;
assured her that I should ever remember her with friendly regard;
and signed my name with a tremendous flourish at the bottom of the
second page. With the note, however, I sent her a raised pie and a
red and green shawl, of which I begged her acceptance in token of
amity; and as neither of those gifts was returned, I concluded that
she ate the one and wore the other, and that there was peace
between us.</p>
<p>But the scales of fortune as they go up for one, go down for
another. This man's luck is balanced by that man's ruin--Orestes
falls sick, and Pylades returns from Kissingen cured of his
lumbago--old Croesus dies, and little Miss Kilmansegg comes into
the world with a golden spoon in her mouth, So it fell out with
Franz M&uuml;ller and myself. As I happily steered clear of
Charybdis, he drifted into Scylla--in other words, just as I
recovered from my second attack of the tender passion, he caught
the epidemic and fancied himself in love with the fair Marie.</p>
<p>I say "fancied," because his way of falling in love was so
unlike my way, that I could scarcely believe it to be the same
complaint. It affected neither his appetite, nor his spirits, nor
his wardrobe. He made as many puns and smoked as many pipes as
usual. He did not even buy a new hat. If, in fact, he had not told
me himself, I should never have guessed that anything whatever was
the matter with him.</p>
<p>It came out one day when he was pressing me to go with him to a
certain tea-party at Madame Marotte's, in the Rue St. Denis.</p>
<p>"You see," said he, "it is <i>la petite</i> Marie's f&ecirc;te;
and the party's in her honor; and they'd be so proud if we both
went to it; and--and, upon my soul, I'm awfully fond of that little
girl"....</p>
<p>"Of Marie Marotte?"</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>"You are not serious," I said.</p>
<p>"I am as serious," he replied, "as a dancing dervish."</p>
<p>And then, for I suppose I looked incredulous, he went on to
justify himself.</p>
<p>"She's very good," he said, "and very pretty. Quite a Madonna
face, to my thinking."</p>
<p>"You may see a dozen such Madonna faces among the nurses in the
Luxembourg Gardens, every afternoon of your life," said I.</p>
<p>"Oh, if you come to that, every woman is like every other woman,
up to a certain point."</p>
<p>"<i>Les femmes se suivent et se ressemblent toujours</i>," said
I, parodying a well-known apothegm.</p>
<p>"Precisely, but then they wear their rue, or cause you to wear
yours, 'with a difference.' This girl, however, escapes the
monotony of her sex by one or two peculiarities:--she has not a bit
of art about her, nor a shred of coquetry. She is as simple and as
straightforward as an Arcadian. She doesn't even know when she is
being made love to, or understand what you mean, when you pay her a
compliment."</p>
<p>"Then she's a phenomenon--and what man in his senses would fall
in love with a phenomenon?"</p>
<p>"Every man, <i>mon cher enfant</i>, who falls in love at all!
The woman we worship is always a phenomenon, whether of beauty, or
grace, or virtue--till we find her out; and then, probably, she
becomes a phenomenon of deceit, or slovenliness, or bad temper! And
now, to return to the point we started from--will you go with me to
Madame Marotte's tea-party to-morrow evening at eight? Don't say
'No,' there's a good fellow."</p>
<p>"I'll certainly not say No, if you particularly want me to say
Yes," I replied, "but--"</p>
<p>"Prythee, no buts! Let it be Yes, and the thing is settled.
So--here we are. Won't you come in and smoke a pipe with me? I've a
bottle of capital Rhenish in the cupboard."</p>
<p>We had met near the Od&eacute;on, and, as our roads lay in the
same direction, had gone on walking and talking till we came to
M&uuml;ller's own door in the Rue Clovis. I accepted the
invitation, and followed him in. The <i>porti&egrave;re</i>, a
sour-looking, bent old woman with a very dirty duster tied about
her head, hobbled out from her little dark den at the foot of the
stairs, and handed him the key of his apartment.</p>
<p>"<i>Tiens</i>!" said she, "wait a moment--there's a parcel for
you, M'sieur M&uuml;ller."</p>
<p>And so, hobbling back again, she brought out a small flat brown
paper-packet sealed at both ends.</p>
<p>"Ah, I see--from the Emperor!" said M&uuml;ller. "Did he bring
it himself, Madame Duph&ocirc;t, or did he send it by the
Archbishop of Paris?"</p>
<p>A faint grin flitted over the little old woman's withered
face.</p>
<p>"Get along with you, M'sieur M&uuml;ller," she said. "You're
always playing the <i>farceur</i>! The parcel was brought by a man
who looked like a stonemason."</p>
<p>"And nobody has called?"</p>
<p>"Nobody, except M'sieur Richard."</p>
<p>"Monsieur Richard's visits are always gratifying and
delightful--may the <i>diable</i> fly away with him!" said
M&uuml;ller. "What did dear Monsieur Richard want to-day, Madame
Duph&ocirc;t?"</p>
<p>"He wanted to see you, and the third-floor gentleman also--about
the rent."</p>
<p>"Dear Richard! What an admirable memory he has for dates! Did he
leave any message, Madame Duph&ocirc;t?"</p>
<p>The old woman looked at me, and hesitated.</p>
<p>"He says, M'sieur M&uuml;ller--he says ..."</p>
<p>"Nay, this gentleman is a friend--you may speak out. What does
our beloved and respected <i>propri&eacute;taire</i> say, Madame
Duph&ocirc;t?"</p>
<p>"He says, if you don't both of you pay up the arrears by midday
on Sunday next, he'll seize your goods, and turn you into the
street."</p>
<p>"Ah, I always said he was the nicest man I knew!" observed
M&uuml;ller, gravely. "Anything else, Madame Duph&ocirc;t?"</p>
<p>"Only this, Monsieur M&uuml;ller--that if you didn't go quietly,
he'd take your windows out of the frames and your doors off the
hinges."</p>
<p>"<i>Comment</i>! He bade you give me that message, the miserable
old son of a spider! <i>Quatre-vingt mille plats de diables aux
truffes</i>! Take my windows out of the frames, indeed! Let him
try, Madame Duph&ocirc;t--that's all--let him try!"</p>
<p>And with this, M&uuml;ller, in a towering rage, led the way
upstairs, muttering volleys of the most extraordinary and eccentric
oaths of his own invention, and leaving the little old
<i>porti&egrave;re</i> grinning maliciously in the hall.</p>
<p>"But can't you pay him?" said I.</p>
<p>"Whether I can, or can't, it seems I must," he replied, kicking
open the door of his studio as viciously as if it were the
corporeal frame of Monsieur Richard. "The only question is--how? At
the present moment, I haven't five francs in the till."</p>
<p>"Nor have I more than twenty. How much is it?"</p>
<p>"A hundred and sixty--worse luck!"</p>
<p>"Haven't the Tapottes paid for any of their ancestors yet?"</p>
<p>"Confound it!--yes; they've paid for a Marshal of France and a
Farmer General, which are all I've yet finished and sent home. But
there was the washerwoman, and the <i>traiteur</i>, and the
artist's colorman, and, <i>enfin</i>, the devil to pay--and the
money's gone, somehow!"</p>
<p>"I've only just cleared myself from a lot of debts," I said,
ruefully, "and I daren't ask either my father or Dr. Ch&eacute;ron
for an advance just at present. What is to be done?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know. I must raise the money somehow. I must sell
something--there's my copy of Titian's 'Pietro Aretino.' It's worth
eighty francs, if only for a sign. And there's a Madonna and Child
after Andrea del Sarto, worth a fortune to any enterprising
sage-femme with artistic proclivities. I'll try what Nebuchadnezzar
will do for me."</p>
<p>"And who, in the name of all that's Israelitish, is
Nebuchadnezzar?"</p>
<p>"Nebuchadnezzar, my dear Arbuthnot, is a worthy Shylock of my
acquaintance--a gentleman well known to Bohemia--one who buys and
sells whatever is purchasable and saleable on the face of the
globe, from a ship of war to a comic paragraph in the
<i>Charivari</i>. He deals in bric-&agrave;-brac, sermons,
government sinecures, pugs, false hair, light literature, patent
medicines, and the fine arts. He lives in the Place des Victoires.
Would you like to be introduced to him?"</p>
<p>"Immensely."</p>
<p>"Well, then, be here by eight to-morrow morning, and I'll take
you with me. After nine he goes out, or is only visible to buyers.
Here's my bottle of Rhenish--genuine Assmanshauser. Are you
hungry?"</p>
<p>I admitted that I was not unconscious of a sensation akin to
appetite.</p>
<p>He gazed steadfastly into the cupboard, and shook his head.</p>
<p>"A box of sardines," he said, gloomily, "nearly empty. Half a
loaf, evidently disinterred from Pompeii. An inch of Lyons sausage,
saved from the ark; the remains of a bottle of fish sauce, and a
pot of currant jelly. What will you have?"</p>
<p>I decided for the relics of Pompeii and the deluge, and we sat
down to discuss those curious delicacies. Having no corkscrew, we
knocked off the neck of the bottle, and being short of glasses,
drank our wine out of teacups.</p>
<p>"But you have never opened your parcel all this time," I said
presently. "It may be full of <i>billets de banque</i>--who can
tell?"</p>
<p>"That's true," said M&uuml;ller; and broke the seals.</p>
<p>"By all the Gods of Olympus!" he shouted, holding up a small
oblong volume bound in dark green cloth. "My sketch-book!"</p>
<p>He opened it, and a slip of paper fell out. On this slip of
paper were written, in a very neat, small hand, the words,
"<i>Returned with thanks</i>;" but the page that contained the
sketch made in the Caf&eacute; Procope was missing.</p>

<h3>AN EVENING PARTY AMONG THE PETIT-BOURGEOISIE.</h3>
<br>
<p>Madame Marotte, as I have already mentioned more than once,
lived in the Rue du Faubourg St. Denis; which, as all the world
knows, is a prolongation of the Rue St. Denis--just as the Rue St.
Denis was, in my time, a transpontine continuation of the old Rue
de la Harpe. Beginning at the Place du Ch&acirc;telet as the Rue
St. Denis, opening at its farther end on the Boulevart St. Denis
and passing under the triumphal arch of Louis le Grand (called the
Porte St. Denis), it there becomes first the Rue du Faubourg St.
Denis, and then the interminable Grande Route du St. Denis which
drags its slow length along all the way to the famous Abbey outside
Paris.</p>
<p>The Rue du Faubourg St. Denis is a changed street now, and
widens out, prim, white, and glittering, towards the new barrier
and the new Rond Point. But in the dear old days of which I tell,
it was the sloppiest, worst-paved, worst-lighted, noisiest,
narrowest, and most crowded of all the great Paris thoroughfares
north of the Seine. All the country traffic from Chantilly and
Compi&eacute;gne came lumbering this way into the city; diligences,
omnibuses, wagons, fiacres, water-carts, and all kinds of vehicles
thronged and blocked the street perpetually; and the sound of
wheels ceased neither by night nor by day. The foot-pavements of
the Rue du Faubourg St. Denis, too, were always muddy, be the
weather what it might; and the gutters were always full of stagnant
pools. An ever-changing, never-failing stream of rustics from the
country, workpeople from the factories of the <i>banlieu,</i>
grisettes, commercial travellers, porters, commissionaires, and
<i>gamins</i> of all ages here flowed to and fro. Itinerant venders
of cakes, lemonade, cocoa, chickweed, <i>allumettes</i>,
pincushions, six-bladed penknives, and never-pointed pencils filled
the air with their cries, and made both day and night hideous. You
could not walk a dozen yards at any time without falling down a
yawning cellar-trap, or being run over by a porter with a huge load
upon his head, or getting splashed from head to foot by the sudden
pulling-up of some cart in the gutter beside you.</p>
<p>It was among the peculiarities of the Rue du Faubourg St. Denis
that everybody was always in a hurry, and that nobody was ever seen
to look in at the shop-windows. The shops, indeed, might as well
have had no windows, since there were no loungers to profit by
them. Every house, nevertheless, was a shop, and every shop had its
window. These windows, however, were for the most part of that kind
before which the passer-by rarely cares to linger; for the commerce
of the Rue du Faubourg St. Denis was of that steady, unpretending,
money-making sort that despises mere shop-front attractions.
Grocers, stationers, corn-chandlers, printers, cutlers,
leather-sellers, and such other inelegant trades, here most did
congregate; and to the wearied wayfarer toiling along the dead
level of this dreary pav&eacute;, it was quite a relief to come
upon even an artistically-arranged <i>Magasin de Charcuterie</i>,
with its rows of glazed tongues, mighty Lyons sausages, yellow
<i>terrines</i> of Strasbourg pies, fantastically shaped
pickle-jars, and pyramids of silvery sardine boxes.</p>
<p>It was at number One Hundred and Two in this agreeable
thoroughfare that my friend's innamorata resided with her maternal
aunt, the worthy relict of Monsieur Jacques Marotte,
umbrella-maker, deceased. Thither, accordingly, we wended our miry
way, M&uuml;ller and I, after dining together at one of our
accustomed haunts on the evening following the events related in my
last chapter. The day had been dull and drizzly, and the evening
had turned out duller and more drizzly still. We had not had rain
for some time, and the weather had been (as it often is in Paris in
October) oppressively hot; and now that the rain had come, it did
not seem to cool the air at all, but rather to load it with vapors,
and make the heat less endurable than before.</p>
<p>Having toiled all the way up from the Rue de la Harpe on the
farther bank of the Seine, and having forded the passage of the
Arch of Louis le Grand, we were very wet and muddy indeed, very
much out of breath, and very melancholy objects to behold.</p>
<p>"It's dreadful to think of going into any house in this
condition, M&uuml;ller," said I, glancing down ruefully at the
state of my boots, and having just received a copious spattering of
mud all down the left side of my person. "What is to be done?"</p>
<p>"We've only to go to a boot-cleaning and brushing-up shop,"
replied M&uuml;ller. "There's sure to be one close by
somewhere."</p>
<p>"A boot-cleaning and brushing-up shop!" I echoed.</p>
<p>"What--didn't you know there were lots of them, all over Paris?
Have you never noticed places that look like shops, with ground
glass windows instead of shop-fronts, on which are painted up the
words, '<i>cirage des bottes?</i>'"</p>
<p>"Never, that I can remember."</p>
<p>"Then be grateful to me for a piece of very useful information!
Suppose we turn down this by-street--it's mostly to the seclusion
of by-streets and passages that our bashful sex retires to renovate
its boots and its broadcloth."</p>
<p>I followed him, and in the course of a few minutes we found the
sort of place of which we were in search. It consisted of one
large, long room, like a shop without goods, counters, or shelves.
A single narrow bench ran all round the walls, raised on a sort of
wooden platform about three feet in width and three feet from the
ground. Seated upon this bench, somewhat uncomfortably, as it
seemed, with their backs against the wall, sat some ten or a dozen
men and boys, each with an attendant shoeblack kneeling before him,
brushing away vigorously. Two or three other customers, standing up
in the middle of the shop, like horses in the hands of the groom,
were having their coats brushed instead of their boots. Of those
present, some looked like young shopmen, some were of the
<i>ouvrier</i> class, and one or two looked like respectable small
tradesmen and fathers of families. The younger men were evidently
smartening up for an hour or two at some cheap ball or
Caf&eacute;-Concert, now that the warehouse was closed, and the
day's work was over.</p>
<p>Our boots being presently brought up to the highest degree of
polish, and our garments cleansed of every disfiguring speck, we
paid a few sous apiece and turned out again into the streets.
Happily, we had not far to go. A short cut brought us into the
midst of the Rue de Faubourg St. Denis, and within a few yards of a
gloomy-looking little shop with the words "<i>Veuve Marotte</i>"
painted up over the window, and a huge red and white umbrella
dangling over the door. A small boy in a shiny black apron was at
that moment putting up the shutters; the windows of the front room
over the shop were brightly lit from within; and a little old
gentleman in goloshes and a large blue cloak with a curly collar,
was just going in at the private door. We meekly followed him, and
hung up our hats and overcoats, as he did, in the passage.</p>
<p>"After you, Messieurs," said the little old gentleman, skipping
politely back, and flourishing his hand in the direction of the
stairs. "After you!"</p>
<p>We protested vehemently against this arrangement, and fought
quite a skirmish of civilities at the foot of the stairs.</p>
<p>"I am at home here, Messieurs," said the little old gentleman,
who, now that he was divested of hat, cloak, and goloshes, appeared
in a flaxen <i>toupet</i>, an antiquated blue coat with brass
buttons, a profusely frilled shirt, and low-cut shoes with silver
buckles. "I am an old friend of the family--a friend of fifty
years. I hold myself privileged to do the honors, Messieurs;--a
friend of fifty years may claim to have his privileges."</p>
<p>With this he smirked, bowed, and backed against the wall, so
that we were obliged to precede him. When we reached the landing,
however, he (being evidently an old gentleman of uncommon
politeness and agility) sprang forward, held open the door for us,
and insisted on ushering us in.</p>
<p>It was a narrow, long-shaped room, the size of the shop, with
two windows looking upon the street; a tiny square of carpet in the
middle of the floor; boards highly waxed and polished; a tea-table
squeezed up in one corner; a somewhat ancient-looking,
spindle-legged cottage piano behind the door; a mirror and an
ornamental clock over the mantelpiece; and a few French
lithographs, colored in imitation of crayon drawings, hanging
against the walls.</p>
<p>Madame Marotte, very deaf and fussy, in a cap with white
ribbons, came forward to receive us. Mademoiselle Marie, sitting
between two other young women of her own age, hung her head, and
took no notice of our arrival.</p>
<p>The rest of the party consisted of a gentleman and two old
ladies. The gentleman (a plump, black-whiskered elderly Cupid, with
a vast expanse of shirt-front like an immense white ace of hearts,
and a rose in his button-hole) was standing on the hearth-rug in a
graceful attitude, with one hand resting on his hip, and the other
under his coat-tails. Of the two old ladies, who seemed as if
expressly created by nature to serve as foils to one another, one
was very fat and rosy, in a red silk gown and a kind of black
velvet hat trimmed with white marabout feathers and Roman pearls;
while the other was tall, gaunt, and pale, with a long nose, a long
upper lip, and supernaturally long yellow teeth. She wore a black
gown, black cotton gloves, and a black velvet band across her
forehead, fastened in the centre with a black and gold clasp
containing a ghastly representation of a human eye, apparently
purblind--which gave this lady the air of a serious Cyclops.</p>
<p>Madame Marotte was profuse of thanks, welcomes, apologies, and
curtseys. It was so good of these gentlemen to come so far--and in
such unpleasant weather, too! But would not these Messieurs give
themselves the trouble to be seated? And would they prefer tea or
coffee--for both were on the table? And where was Marie? Marie,
whose <i>f&ecirc;te</i>-day it was, and who should have come
forward to welcome these gentlemen, and thank them for the honor of
their company!</p>
<p>Thus summoned, Mademoiselle Marie emerged from between the two
young women, and curtsied demurely.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, the little old gentleman who had ushered as in
was bustling about the room, shaking hands with every one, and
complimenting the ladies.</p>
<p>"Ah, Madame Desjardins," he said, addressing the stout lady in
the hat, "enchanted to see you back from the sea-side!--you and
your charming daughter. I do not know which looks the more young
and blooming."</p>
<p>Then, turning to the grim lady in black:--</p>
<p>"And I am charmed to pay my homage to Madame de Montparnasse. I
had the pleasure of being present at the brilliant
<i>d&eacute;but</i> of Madame's gifted daughter the other evening
at the private performance of the pupils of the Conservatoire.
Mademoiselle Honoria inherits the <i>grand air</i>, Madame, from
yourself."</p>
<p>Then, to the plump gentleman with the shirt-front:--</p>
<p>"And Monsieur Philom&egrave;ne!--this is indeed a privilege and
a pleasure. Bad weather, Monsieur Philom&egrave;ne, for the
voice!"</p>
<p>Then, to the two girls:--</p>
<p>"Mesdemoiselles--Achille Dorinet prostrates himself at the feet
of youth, beauty, and talent! Mademoiselle Honoria, I salute in you
the future Empress of the tragic stage. Mademoiselle Rosalie,
modesty forbids me to extol the acquired graces of even my most
promising pupil; but I may be permitted to adore in you the graces
of nature."</p>
<p>While I was listening to these scraps of salutation, M&uuml;ller
was murmuring tender nothings in the ear of the fair Marie, and
Madame Marotte was pouring out the coffee.</p>
<p>Monsieur Achille Dorinet, having gone the round of the company,
next addressed himself to me.</p>
<p>"Permit me, Monsieur," he said, bringing his heels together and
punctuating his sentences with little bows, "permit me, in the
absence of a master of the ceremonies, to introduce myself--Achille
Dorinet, Achille Dorinet, whose name may not, perhaps, be wholly
unknown to you in connection with the past glories of the classical
ballet. Achille Dorinet, formerly <i>premier sujet</i> of the
Op&eacute;ra Fran&ccedil;ais--now principal choreographic professor
at the Conservatoire Imp&eacute;riale de Musique. I have had the
honor, Monsieur, of dancing at Erfurth before their Imperial
Majesties the Emperors Napoleon and Alexander, and a host of minor
sovereigns. Those, Monsieur, were the high and palmy days of the
art. We performed a ballet descriptive of the siege of Troy, and I
undertook the part of a river god--the god Scamander, <i>en
effet</i>. The great ladies of the court, Monsieur, were graciously
pleased to admire my proportions as the god Scamander. I wore a
girdle of sedges, a wreath of water-lilies, and a scarf of blue and
silver. I have reason to believe that the costume became me."</p>
<p>"Sir," I replied gravely, "I do not doubt it."</p>
<p>"It is a noble art, Monsieur, <i>l'art de la dame</i>" said the
former <i>premier sujet</i>, with a sigh; "but it is on the
decline. Of the grand style of fifty years ago, only myself and
tradition remain."</p>
<p>"Monsieur was, doubtless, a contemporary of Vestris, the famous
dancer," I said.</p>
<p>"The illustrious Vestris, Monsieur," said the little old
gentleman, "was, next to Louis the Fourteenth, the greatest of
Frenchmen. I am proud to own myself his disciple, as well as his
contemporary."</p>
<p>"Why next to Louis the Fourteenth, Monsieur Dorinet?" I asked,
keeping my countenance with difficulty. "Why not next to Napoleon
the First, who was a still greater conqueror?"</p>
<p>"But no dancer, Monsieur!" replied the ex-god Scamander, with a
kind of half pirouette; "whereas the Grand Monarque was the finest
dancer of his epoch."</p>
<p>Madame Marotte had by this time supplied all her guests with tea
and coffee, while Monsieur Philom&egrave;ne went round with the
cakes and bread and butter. Madame Desjardins spread her
pocket-handkerchief on her lap--a pocket-handkerchief the size of a
small table-cloth. Madame de Montparnasse, more mindful of her
gentility, removed to a corner of the tea-table, and ate her bread
and butter in her black cotton gloves.</p>
<p>"We hope we have another bachelor by-and-by," said Madame
Marotte, addressing herself to the young ladies, who looked down
and giggled. "A charming man, mesdemoiselles, and quite the
gentleman--our <i>locataire</i>, M'sieur Lenoir. You know him,
M'sieur Dorinet--pray tell these demoiselles what a charming man
M'sieur Lenoir is!"</p>
<p>The little dancing-master bowed, coughed, smiled, and looked
somewhat embarrassed.</p>
<p>"Monsieur Lenoir is no doubt a man of much information," he
said, hesitatingly; "a traveller--a reader--a gentleman--oh! yes,
certainly a gentleman. But to say that he is a--a charming man ...
well, perhaps the ladies are the best judges of such nice
questions. What says Mam'selle Marie?"</p>
<p>Thus applied to, the fair Marie became suddenly crimson, and had
not a word to reply with. Monsieur Dorinet stared. The young ladies
tittered. Madame Marotte, deaf as a post and serenely unconscious,
smiled, nodded, and said "Ah, yes, yes--didn't I tell you so?"</p>
<p>"Monsieur Dorinet has, I fear, asked an indiscreet question,"
said M&uuml;ller, boiling over with jealousy.</p>
<p>"I--I have not observed Monsieur Lenoir sufficiently to--to form
an opinion," faltered Marie, ready to cry with vexation.</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller glared at her reproachfully, turned on his heel, and
came over to where I was standing.</p>
<p>"You saw how she blushed?" he said in a fierce whisper.
"<i>Sacredie</i>! I'll bet my head she's an arrant flirt. Who, in
the name of all the fiends, is this lodger she's been carrying on
with? A lodger, too--oh! the artful puss!"</p>
<p>At this awkward moment, Monsieur Dorinet, with considerable
tact, asked Monsieur Philom&egrave;ne for a song; and Monsieur
Philom&egrave;ne (who as I afterwards learned was a favorite tenor
at fifth-rate concerts) was graciously pleased to comply.</p>
<p>Not, however, without a little preliminary coquetry, after the
manner of tenors. First he feared he was hoarse; then struck a note
or two on the piano, and tried his falsetto; then asked for a glass
of water; and finally begged that one of the young ladies would be
so amiable as to accompany him.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle Honoria, inheriting rigidity from the maternal
Cyclops, drew herself up and declined stiffly; but the other, whom
the dancing-master had called Rosalie, got up directly and said she
would do her best.</p>
<p>"Only," she added, blushing, "I play so badly!"</p>
<p>Monsieur Philom&egrave;ne was provided with two copies of his
song--one for the accompanyist and one for himself; then, standing
well away from the piano with his face to the audience, he balanced
his music in his hand, made his little professional bow, coughed,
ran his fingers through his hair, and assumed an expression of
tender melancholy.</p>
<p>"One--two--three," began Mdlle. Rosalie, her little fat fingers
staggering helplessly among the first cadenzas of the symphony.
"One--two--three. One" ...</p>
<p>Monsieur Philom&egrave;ne interrupted with a wave of the hand,
as if conducting an orchestra.</p>
<p>"Pardon, Mademoiselle," he said, "not quite so fast, if you
please! Andantino--andantino--one--two--three ... Just so! A
thousand thanks!"</p>
<p>Again Mdlle. Rosalie attacked the symphony. Again Monsieur
Philom&egrave;ne cleared his voice, and suffered a pensive languor
to cloud his manly brow.</p>
<blockquote>"<i>Revenez, revenez, beaux jours de mon
enfance,</i>"</blockquote>
<p>he began, in a small, tremulous, fluty voice.</p>
<p>"They'll have a long road to travel back, <i>parbleu</i>!"
muttered M&uuml;ller.</p>
<blockquote>"<i>De votre aspect riant charmer ma
souvenance</i>!"</blockquote>
<p>Here Mdlle. Rosalie struck a wrong chord, became involved in
hopeless difficulties, and gasped audibly.</p>
<p>Monsieur Philom&egrave;ne darted a withering glance at her, and
went on:--</p>
<blockquote>"<i>Mon coeur; mon pauvre coeur</i>" ...</blockquote>
<p>More wrong chords, and a smothered "<i>mille pardons</i>!" from
Mdlle. Rosalie.</p>
<blockquote>"<i>Mon coeur, mon pauvre coeur a la tristesse en
proie,<br>
En fouillant le pass&eacute;"....</i></blockquote>
<p>A dead stop on the part of Mdlle. Rosalie.</p>
<blockquote><i>"En fouillant le pass&eacute;</i>"....</blockquote>
<p>repeated the tenor, with the utmost severity of emphasis.</p>
<p>"<i>Mais, mon Dieu</i>, Rosalie! what are you doing?" cried
Madame Desjardins, angrily. "Why don't you go on?"</p>
<p>Mdlle. Rosalie burst into a flood of tears.</p>
<p>"I--I can't!" she sobbed. "It's so--so very
difficult--and"...</p>
<p>Madame Desjardins flung up her hands in despair.</p>
<p>"<i>Ciel</i>!" she cried, "and I have been paying three francs a
lesson for you, Mademoiselle, twice a week for the last six
years!"</p>
<p>"<i>Mais, maman</i>"....</p>
<p>"<i>Fi done</i>, Mademoiselle! I am ashamed of you. Make a
curtsey to Monsieur Philom&egrave;ne this moment, and beg his
pardon; for you have spoiled his beautiful song!"</p>
<p>But Monsieur Philom&egrave;ne would hear of no such expiation.
His soul, to use his own eloquent language, recoiled from it with
horror! The accompaniment, <i>&agrave; vrai dire</i>, was not easy,
and <i>la bien aimable</i> Mam'selle Rosalie had most kindly done
her best with it. <i>Allons donc!</i>--on condition that no more
should be said on the subject, Monsieur Philom&egrave;ne would
volunteer to sing a little unaccompanied romance of his own
composition--a mere <i>bagatelle</i>; but a tribute to "<i>les
beaux yeux de ces ch&egrave;res dames</i>!"</p>
<p>So Mam'selle Rosalie wiped away her tears, and Madame Desjardins
smoothed her ruffled feathers, and Monsieur Philom&egrave;ne
warbled a plaintive little ditty in which "<i>coeur</i>" rhymed to
"<i>peur</i>" and "<i>amours</i>" to "<i>toujours</i>" and "<i>le
sort</i>" to "<i>la mort</i>" in quite the usual way; so giving
great satisfaction to all present, but most, perhaps, to
himself.</p>
<p>And now, hospitably anxious that each of her guests should have
a chance of achieving distinction, Madame Marotte invited Mdlle.
Honoria to favor the company with a dramatic recitation.</p>
<p>Mdlle. Honoria hesitated; exchanged glances with the Cyclops;
and, in order to enhance the value of her performance, began
raising all kinds of difficulties. There was no stage, for
instance; and there were no footlights; but M. Dorinet met these
objections by proposing to range all the seats at one end of the
room, and to divide the stage off by a row of lighted candles.</p>
<p>"But it is so difficult to render a dramatic scene without an
interlocutor!" said the young lady.</p>
<p>"What is it you require, <i>ma ch&egrave;re demoiselle?</i>"
asked Madame Marotte.</p>
<p>"I have no interlocutor," said Mdlle. Honoria.</p>
<p>"No what, my love?"</p>
<p>"No interlocutor," repeated Mdlle. Honoria, at the top of her
voice.</p>
<p>"Dear! dear! what a pity! Can't we send the boy for it? Marie,
my child, bid Jacques run to Madame de Montparnasse's
<i>appartement</i> in the Rue" ...</p>
<p>But Madame Marotte's voice was lost in the confusion; for
Monsieur Dorinet was already deep in the arrangement of the room,
and we were all helping to move the furniture. As for
Mademoiselle's last difficulty, the little dancing-master met that
by offering to read whatever was necessary to carry on the
scene.</p>
<p>And now, the stage being cleared, the audience placed, and
Monsieur Dorinet provided with a volume of Corneille, Mademoiselle
Honoria proceeded to drape herself in an old red shawl belonging to
Madame Marotte.</p>
<p>The scene selected is the fifth of the fourth act of Horace,
where Camille, meeting her only surviving brother, upbraids him
with the death of Curiace.</p>
<p>Mam'selle Honoria, as Camille, with clasped hands and tragic
expression, stalks in a slow and stately manner towards the
footlights.</p>
<p>(Breathless suspense of the audience.)</p>
<p>M. Dorinet, who should begin by vaunting his victory over the
Curiatii, stops to put on his glasses, finds it difficult to read
with all the candles on the ground, and mutters something about the
smallness of the type.</p>
<p>Mdlle. Honoria, not to keep the audience waiting, surveys the
ex-god Seamander with a countenance expressive of horror; starts;
and takes a turn across the stage.</p>
<p>"<i>Ma soeur,</i>" begins M. Dorinet, holding the book very much
on one side, so as to catch the light upon the page, "<i>ma soeur,
voici le bras</i>"....</p>
<p>"Ah, Heaven! my dear Mademoiselle, take care of the candles!"
cries Madame Marotte in a shrill whisper.</p>
<blockquote>... "<i>le bras qui venge nos deux fr&egrave;res,<br>
Le bras qui rompt le cours de nos destins contraires,<br>
Qui nous rend"</i>...</blockquote>
<p>Here he lost his place; stammered; and recovered it with
difficulty.</p>
<blockquote><i>"Qui nous rend ma&icirc;tres
d'Albe"</i>....</blockquote>
<p>Madame Marotte groans aloud in an agony of apprehension</p>
<p>"<i>Ah, mon Dieu!</i>" she exclaims, gaspingly, "if they didn't
flare so, it wouldn't be half so dangerous!"</p>
<p>Here M. Dorinet dropped his book, and stooping to pick up the
book, dropped his spectacles.</p>
<p>"I think," said Mdlle. Honoria, indignantly, "we had better
begin again. Monsieur Dorinet, pray read with the help of a candle
<i>this</i> time!"</p>
<p>And, with an angry toss of her head, Mdlle. Honoria went up the
stage, put on her tragedy face again, and prepared once more to
stalk down to the footlights.</p>
<p>Monsieur Dorinet, in the meanwhile, had snatched up a candle,
readjusted his spectacles, and found his place.</p>
<p>"<i>Ma soeur</i>" he began again, holding the book close to his
eyes and the candle just under his nose, and nodding vehemently
with every emphasis:--</p>
<blockquote>"<i>Ma soeur, voici le bras qui venge nos deux
fr&egrave;res,<br>
Le bras qui rompt le cours de nos destins contraires,<br>
Qui nous rend ma&icirc;tres d'Albe</i>" ...</blockquote>
<p>A piercing scream from Madame Marotte, a general cry on the part
of the audience, and a strong smell of burning, brought the
dancing-master to a sudden stop. He looked round, bewildered.</p>
<p>"Your wig! Your wig's on fire!" cried every one at once.</p>
<p>Monsieur Dorinet clapped his hand to his head, which was now
adorned with a rapidly-spreading glory; burned his fingers; and cut
a frantic caper.</p>
<p>"Save him! save him!" yelled Madame Marotte.</p>
<p>But almost before the words were out of her mouth, M&uuml;ller,
clearing the candles at a bound, had rushed to the rescue, scalped
Monsieur Dorinet by a <i>tour de main</i>, cast the blazing wig
upon the floor, and trampled out the fire.</p>
<p>Then followed a roar of "inextinguishable laughter," in which,
however, neither the tragic Camille nor the luckless Horace
joined.</p>
<p>"Heavens and earth!" murmured the little dancing-master,
ruefully surveying the ruins of his blonde peruke. And then he put
his hand to his head, which was as bald as an egg.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Mdlle. Honoria, who had not yet succeeded in
uttering a syllable of her part, took no pains to dissemble her
annoyance; and was only pacified at last by a happy proposal on the
part of Monsieur Philom&egrave;ne, who suggested that "this gifted
demoiselle" should be entreated to favor the society with a
soliloquy.</p>
<p>Thus invited, she draped herself again, stalked down to the
footlights for the third time, and in a high, shrill voice, with
every variety of artificial emphasis and studied gesture, recited
Voltaire's famous "Death of Coligny," from the <i>Henriade</i>.</p>
<p>In the midst of this performance, just at that point when the
assassins are described as falling upon their knees before their
victim, the door of the room was softly opened, and another guest
slipped in unseen behind us. Slipped in, indeed, so quietly that
(the backs of the audience being turned that way) no one seemed to
hear, and no one looked round but myself.</p>
<p>Brief as was that glance, and all in the shade as he stood, I
recognised him instantly.</p>
<p>It was the mysterious stranger of the Caf&eacute; Procope.</p>
<br>

<h3>MY AUNT'S FLOWER GARDEN.</h3>
<br>
<p>Having despatched the venerable Coligny much to her own
satisfaction and apparently to the satisfaction of her hearers,
Mdlle. Honoria returned to private life; Messieurs Philom&egrave;ne
and Dorinet removed the footlights; the audience once more
dispersed itself about the room; and Madame Marotte welcomed the
new-comer as Monsieur Lenoir.</p>
<p>"<i>Monsieur est bien aimable</i>," she said, nodding and
smiling, and, with tremulous hands, smoothing down the front of her
black silk gown. "I had told these young ladies that we hoped for
the honor of Monsieur's society. Will Monsieur permit me to
introduce him?"</p>
<p>"With pleasure, Madame Marotte."</p>
<p>And M. Lenoir--white cravatted, white kid-gloved, hat in hand,
perfectly well-dressed in full evening black, and wearing a small
orange-colored rosette at his button-hole--bowed, glanced round the
room, and, though his eyes undoubtedly took in both M&uuml;ller and
myself, looked as if he had never seen either of us in his
life.</p>
<p>I&lt; saw M&uuml;ller start, and the color fly into his
face.</p>
<p>"By Heaven!" he exclaimed, "it is--it must be ... look at him,
Arbuthnot! If that isn't the man who stole my sketch-book, I'll eat
my head!"</p>
<p>"It <i>is</i> the man," I replied. "I recognised him ten minutes
ago, when he first came in."</p>
<p>"You are certain?"</p>
<p>"Quite certain."</p>
<p>"And yet--there is something different!"</p>
<p>There <i>was</i> something different; but, at the same time,
much that was identical. There was the same strange, inscrutable
look, the same bronzed complexion, the same military bearing. M.
Lenoir, it was true, was well, and even elegantly dressed; whereas,
the stranger of the Caf&eacute; Procope bore all the outward
stigmata of penury; but that was not all. There was yet "something
different." The one looked like a man who had done, or suffered, a
wrong in his time; who had an old quarrel with the world; and who
only sought to hide himself, his poverty, and his bitter pride from
the observation of his fellow men. The other stood before us
dignified, <i>d&eacute;cor&eacute;</i>, self-possessed, a man not
only of the world, but apparently no stranger to that small section
of it called "the great world." In a word, the man of the
Caf&eacute;, sunken, sullen, threadbare as he was, would have been
almost less out of his proper place in Madame Marotte's society of
small trades-people and minor professionals, than was M. Lenoir
with his <i>grand air</i> and his orange-colored ribbon.</p>
<p>"It's the same man," said M&uuml;ller; "the same, beyond a
doubt. The more I look at him, the more confident I am."</p>
<p>"And the more I look at him," said I, "the more doubtful I
get."</p>
<p>Madame Marotte, meanwhile, had introduced M. Lenoir to the two
Conservatoire pupils and their mammas; Monsieur Dorinet had
proposed some "<i>petits jeux</i>;" and Monsieur Philom&egrave;ne
was helping him to re-arrange the chairs--this time in a
circle.</p>
<p>"Take your places, Messieurs et Mesdames--take your places!"
cried Monsieur Dorinet, who had by this time resumed his wig,
singed as it was, and shorn of its fair proportions. "What game
shall we play at?"</p>
<p>"<i>Pied de Boeuf</i>" "<i>Colin Maillard</i>" and other games
were successively proposed and rejected.</p>
<p>"We have a game in Alsace called 'My Aunt's Flower Garden'" said
M&uuml;ller. "Does any one know it?"</p>
<p>"'My Aunt's Flower Garden?'" repeated Monsieur Dorinet. "I never
heard of it."</p>
<p>"It sounds pretty," said Mdlle. Rosalie.</p>
<p>"Will M'sieur teach it to us, if it is not very difficult?"
suggested Mdlle. Rosalie's mamma.</p>
<p>"With pleasure, Madame. It is not a bad game--and it is
extremely easy. We will sit in a circle, if you please--the chairs
as they are placed will do quite well."</p>
<p>We were just about to take our places when Madame Marotte seized
the opportunity to introduce M&uuml;ller and myself to M.
Lenoir.</p>
<p>"We have met before, Monsieur," said M&uuml;ller, pointedly.</p>
<p>"I am ashamed to confess, Monsieur, that I do not remember to
have had that pleasure," replied M. Lenoir, somewhat stiffly.</p>
<p>"And yet, Monsieur, it was but the other day," persisted
M&uuml;ller.</p>
<p>"Monsieur, I can but reiterate my regret."</p>
<p>"At the Caf&eacute; Procope."</p>
<p>M. Lenoir stared coldly, slightly shrugged his shoulders, and
said, with the air of one who repudiates a discreditable
charge:--</p>
<p>"Monsieur, I do not frequent the Caf&eacute; Procope."</p>
<p>"If Monsieur M&uuml;ller is to teach us the game, Monsieur
M&uuml;ller must begin it!" said Monsieur Dorinet.</p>
<p>"At once," replied M&uuml;ller, taking his place in the
circle.</p>
<p>As ill-luck would have it (the rest of us being already seated),
there were but two chairs left; so that M. Lenoir and M&uuml;ller
had to sit side by side.</p>
<p>"I begin with my left-hand neighbor," said M&uuml;ller,
addressing himself with a bow to Mdlle. Rosalie; "and the circle
will please to repeat after me:--'I have the four corners of my
Aunt's Flower Garden for sale--</p>
<p>'<i>In the first of these corners grows sweet mignonette; I've
seen thee, and lov'd thee, and ne'er can forget.</i>'"</p>
<p>MDLLE. ROSALIE <i>to</i> M. PHILOM&Egrave;NE.--I have the four
corners of my Aunt's Flower Garden for sale--</p>
<p>'<i>In the first of these corners grows sweet mignonette; I've
seen thee, and lov'd thee, and ne'er can forget.</i>'</p>
<p>M. PHILOM&Egrave;NE <i>to</i> MADAME DE MONTPARNASSE.--I have
the four corners of my Aunt's Flower Garden, etc., etc.</p>
<p>MADAME DE MONTPARNASSE <i>to</i> M. DORINET.--I have the four
corners of my Aunt's Flower Garden, etc., etc.</p>
<p>Monsieur Dorinet repeats the formula to Madame Desjardins;
Madame Desjardins passes it on to me; I proclaim it at the top of
my voice to Madame Marotte; Madame Marotte transfers it to Mdlle.
Honoria; Mdlle. Honoria delivers it to the fair Marie; the fair
Marie tells it to M. Lenoir, and the first round is completed.</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller resumes the lead :--</p>
<blockquote>"<i>In the second grow heartsease and wild
eglantine;<br>
Fair exchange is no theft--for my heart, give me
thine</i>."</blockquote>
<p>MDLLE. ROSALIE <i>to</i> M. PHILOM&Egrave;NE:--</p>
<blockquote>"<i>In the second grow heartsease and wild
eglantine;<br>
Fair exchange is no theft--for my heart, give me
thine</i>."</blockquote>
<p>M. PHILOM&Egrave;NE <i>to</i> MDLLE. DE MONTPARNASSE:--</p>
<blockquote>"<i>In the second grow heartsease</i>," &amp;c.,
&amp;c.</blockquote>
<p>And so on again, till the second round is done. Then M&uuml;ller
began again:--</p>
<blockquote>"<i>In the third of these corners pale primroses
grow;<br>
Now tell me thy secret, and whisper it low</i>."</blockquote>
<p>Mdlle. Rosalie was about to repeat these lines as before; but he
stopped her.</p>
<p>"No, Mademoiselle, not till you have told me the secret."</p>
<p>"The secret, M'sieur? What secret?"</p>
<p>"Nay, Mademoiselle, how can I tell that till you have told me?
You must whisper something to me--something very secret, which you
would not wish any one else to hear--before you repeat the lines.
And when you repeat them, Monsieur Philom&egrave;ne must whisper
his secret to you--and so on through the circle."</p>
<p>Mdlle. Rosalie hesitated, smiled, whispered something in
M&uuml;ller's ear, and went on with:--</p>
<blockquote>"<i>In the third of these corners pale primroses
grow;<br>
Now tell me thy secret, and whisper it low</i>."</blockquote>
<p>Monsieur Philom&egrave;ne then whispered his secret to Mdlle.
Rosalie, and so on again till it ended with M. Lenoir and
M&uuml;ller.</p>
<p>"I don't think it is a very amusing game," said Madame Marotte;
who, being deaf, had been left out of the last round, and found it
dull.</p>
<p>"It will be more entertaining presently, Madame," shouted
M&uuml;ller, with a malicious twinkle about his eyes. "Pray observe
the next lines, Messieurs et Mesdames, and follow my lead as
before:--</p>
<blockquote>'<i>Roses bloom in the fourth; and your secret, my
dear,<br>
Which you whisper'd so softly just now in my ear,<br>
I repeat word for word, for the others to hear!</i>'</blockquote>
<p>Mademoiselle Rosalie (whose pardon I implore!) whispered to me
that Monsieur Philom&egrave;ne dyed his moustache and
whiskers."</p>
<p>There was a general murmur of alarm tempered with tittering.
Mademoiselle Rosalie was dumb with confusion. Monsieur
Philom&egrave;ne's face became the color of a full-blown peony.
Madame de Montparnasse and Mdlle. Honoria turned absolutely
green.</p>
<p>"<i>Comment!</i>" exclaimed one or two voices. "Is everything to
be repeated?"</p>
<p>"Everything, Messieurs et Mesdames," replied
M&uuml;ller--"everything--without reservation. I call upon Mdlle.
Rosalie to reveal the secret of Monsieur Philom&egrave;ne."</p>
<p>MDLLE. ROSALIE (<i>with great promptitude</i>):--Monsieur
Philom&egrave;ne whispered to me that Honoria was the most
disagreeable girl in Paris, Marie the dullest, and myself the
prettiest.</p>
<p>M. PHILOM&Egrave;NE (<i>in an agony of confusion</i>):--I
beseech you, Mam'selle Honoria ... I entreat you, Mam'selle Marie,
not for an instant to suppose....</p>
<p>MDLLE. HONORIA (<i>drawing herself up and smiling
acidly</i>):--Oh, pray do not give yourself the trouble to
apologize, Monsieur Philom&egrave;ne. Your opinion, I assure you,
is not of the least moment to either of us. Is it, Marie?</p>
<p>But the fair Marie only smiled good-naturedly, and said:--</p>
<p>"I know I am not clever. Monsieur Philom&egrave;ne is quite
right; and I am not at all angry with him."</p>
<p>"But--but, indeed, Mesdemoiselles, I--I--am incapable...."
stammered the luckless tenor, wiping the perspiration from his
brow. "I am incapable...."</p>
<p>"Silence in the circle!" cried M&uuml;ller, authoritatively.
"Private civilities are forbidden by the rules of the game. I call
Monsieur Philom&egrave;ne to order, and I demand from him the
secret of Madame de Montparnasse."</p>
<p>M. Philom&egrave;ne looked even more miserable than before.</p>
<p>"I--I ... but it is an odious position! To betray the confidence
of a lady ... Heavens! I cannot."</p>
<p>"The secret!--the secret!" shouted the others, impatiently.</p>
<p>Madame de Montparnasse pursed up her parchment lips, glared upon
us defiantly, and said:--</p>
<p>"Pray don't hesitate about repeating my words, M'sieur
Philom&egrave;ne. I am not ashamed of them."</p>
<p>M. PHILOMENE (<i>reluctantly</i>):--Madame de Montparnasse
observed to me that what she particularly disliked was a mixed
society like--like the present; and that she hoped our friend
Madame Marotte would in future be less indiscriminate in the choice
of her acquaintances.</p>
<p>MULLER (<i>with elaborate courtesy</i>):--We are all infinitely
obliged to Madame de Montparnasse for her opinion of us--(I speak
for the society, as leader of the circle)--and beg to assure her
that we entirely coincide in her views. It rests with Madame to
carry on the game, and to betray the confidence of Monsieur
Dorinet.</p>
<p>MADAME DE MONTPARNASSE (<i>with obvious
satisfaction</i>):--Monsieur Dorinet told me that Rosalie
Desjardin's legs were ill-made, and that she would never make a
dancer, though she practised from now till doomsday.</p>
<p>M. DORINET (<i>springing to his feet as if he had been
shot</i>):--Heavens and earth! Madame de Montparnasse, what have I
done that you should so pervert my words? Mam'selle Rosalie--<i>ma
ch&egrave;re el&egrave;ve</i>, believe me, I never....</p>
<p>"Silence in the circle!" shouted M&uuml;ller again.</p>
<p>M. DORINET:--But, M'sieur, in simple self-defence....</p>
<p>MULLER:--Self-defence, Monsieur Dorinet, is contrary to the
rules of the game. Revenge only is permitted. Revenge yourself on
Madame Desjardins, whose secret it is your turn to tell.</p>
<p>M. DORINET:--Madame Desjardins drew my attention to the toilette
of Madame de Montparnasse. She said: "<i>Mon Dieu!</i> Monsieur
Dorinet, are you not tired of seeing La Montparnasse in that
everlasting old black gown? My Rosalie says she is in mourning for
her ugliness."</p>
<p>MADAME DESJARDINS (<i>laughing heartily</i>):--<i>Eh
bien--oui!</i> I don't deny it; and Rosalie's <i>mot</i> was not
bad. And now, M'sieur the Englishman (<i>turning to me</i>), it is
your turn to be betrayed. Monsieur, whose name I cannot pronounce,
said to me:--"Madame, the French, <i>selon moi</i>, are the best
dressed and most <i>spirituel</i> people of Europe. Their very
silence is witty; and if mankind were, by universal consent, to go
without clothes to-morrow, they would wear the primitive costume of
Adam and Eve more elegantly than the rest of the world, and still
lead the fashion,"</p>
<p>(<i>A murmur of approval on the part of the company, who take
the compliment entirely aux serieux</i>.)</p>
<p>MYSELF (<i>agreeably conscious of having achieved
popularity</i>):--Our hostess's deafness having unfortunately
excluded her from this part of the game, I was honored with the
confidence of Mdlle. Honoria, who informed me that she is to make
her <i>d&eacute;but</i> before long at the Theatre Fran&ccedil;ais,
and hoped that I would take tickets for the occasion.</p>
<p>MDLLE. ROSALIE (<i>satirically</i>):--<i>Brava</i>, Honoria!
What a woman of business you are!</p>
<p>MDLLE. HONORIA (<i>affecting not to hear this
observation</i>)--</p>
<blockquote>"<i>Roses bloom in the fourth, and your secret, my
dear,<br>
Which you whispered so softly just now in my ear,<br>
I repeat word for word for the others to hear</i>."</blockquote>
<p>Marie said to me.... <i>Tiens</i>! Marie, don't pull my dress in
that way. You shouldn't have said it, you know, if it won't bear
repeating! Marie said to me that she could have either Monsieur
M&uuml;ller or Monsieur Lenoir, by only holding up her finger--but
she couldn't make up her mind which she liked best.</p>
<p>MDLLE. MARIE (<i>half crying</i>):--Nay, Honoria--how can you be
so--so unkind ... so spiteful? I--I did not say I could have either
M'sieur M&uuml;ller or... or...</p>
<p>M. LENOIR (<i>with great spirit and good breeding</i>):--Whether
Mademoiselle used those words or not is of very little importance.
The fact remains the same; and is as old as the world. Beauty has
but to will and to conquer.</p>
<p>MULLER:--Order in the circle! The game waits for Mademoiselle
Marie.</p>
<p>MARIE (<i>hesitatingly</i>):--</p>
<blockquote>"<i>Roses bloom in the fourth, and your
secret</i>"</blockquote>
<p>M'sieur Lenoir said that--that he admired the color of my dress,
and that blue became me more than lilac.</p>
<p>MULLER: (<i>coldly</i>)--<i>Pardon</i>, Mademoiselle, but I
happened to overhear what Monsieur Lenoir whispered just now, and
those were not his words. Monsieur Lenoir said, "Look in"... but
perhaps Mademoiselle would prefer me not to repeat more?</p>
<p>MARIE--(<i>in great confusion</i>):--As--as you please,
M'sieur.</p>
<p>MULLER:--Then, Mademoiselle, I will be discreet, and I will not
even impose a forfeit upon you, as I might do, by the laws of the
game. It is for Monsieur Lenoir to continue.</p>
<p>M. LENOIR:--I do not remember what Monsieur M&uuml;ller
whispered to me at the close of the last round.</p>
<p>MULLER (<i>pointedly</i>):--<i>Pardon,</i> Monsieur, I should
have thought that scarcely possible.</p>
<p>M. LENOIR:--It was perfectly unintelligible, and therefore left
no impression on my memory.</p>
<p>MULLER:--Permit me, then, to have the honor of assisting your
memory. I said to you--"Monsieur, if I believed that any modest
young woman of my acquaintance was in danger of being courted by a
man of doubtful character, do you know what I would do? I would
hunt that man down with as little remorse as a ferret hunts down a
rat in a drain."</p>
<p>M. LENOIR:--The sentiment does you honor, Monsieur; but I do not
see the application,</p>
<p>MULLER:--Vous ne le trouvez pas, Monsieur?</p>
<p>M. LENOIR--(<i>with a cold stare, and a scarcely perceptible
shrug of the shoulders</i>):--Non, Monsieur.</p>
<p>Here Mdlle. Rosalie broke in with:--"What are we to do next,
M'sieur M&uuml;ller? Are we to begin another round, or shall we
start a fresh game?"</p>
<p>To which M&uuml;ller replied that it must be "<i>selon le
plaisir de ces dames</i>;" and put the question to the vote.</p>
<p>But too many plain, unvarnished truths had cropped up in the
course of the last round of my Aunt's Flower Garden; and the ladies
were out of humor. Madame de Montparnasse, frigid, Cyclopian, black
as Erebus, found that it was time to go home; and took her leave,
bristling with gentility. The tragic Honoria stalked majestically
after her. Madame Desjardins, mortally offended with M. Dorinet on
the score of Rosalie's legs, also prepared to be gone; while M.
Philom&egrave;ne, convicted of hair-dye and <i>brouill&eacute;</i>
for ever with "the most disagreeable girl in Paris," hastened to
make his adieux as brief as possible.</p>
<p>"A word in your ear, mon cher Dorinet," whispered he, catching
the little dancing-master by the button-hole. "Isn't it the most
unpleasant party you were ever at in your life?"</p>
<p>The ex-god Scamander held up his hands and eyes.</p>
<p>"<i>Eh, mon Dieu</i>!" he replied. "What an evening of
disasters! I have lost my best pupil and my second-best wig!"</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, we went up like the others, and said
good-night to our hostess.</p>
<p>She, good soul! in her deafness, knew nothing about the horrors
of the evening, and was profuse of her civilities. "So amiable of
these gentlemen to honor her little soir&eacute;e--so kind of
M'sieur M&uuml;ller to have exerted himself to make things go off
pleasantly--so sorry we would not stay half an hour longer,"
&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
<p>To all of which M&uuml;ller (with a sly grimace expressive of
contrition) replied only by a profound salutation and a rapid
retreat. Passing M. Lenoir without so much as a glance, he paused a
moment before Mdlle. Marie who was standing near the door, and said
in a tone audible only to her and myself:--</p>
<p>"I congratulate you, Mademoiselle, on your admirable talent for
intrigue. I trust, when you look in the usual place and find the
promised letter, it will prove agreeable reading. J'ai l'honneur,
Mademoiselle, de vous saluer."</p>
<p>I saw the girl flush crimson, then turn deadly white, and draw
back as if his hand had struck her a sudden blow. The next moment
we were half-way down the stairs.</p>
<p>"What, in Heaven's name, does all this mean?" I said, when we
were once more in the street.</p>
<p>"It means," replied M&uuml;ller fiercely, "that the man's a
scoundrel, and the woman, like all other women, is false."</p>
<p>"Then the whisper you overheard" ...</p>
<p>"Was only this:--'<i>Look in the usual place, and you will find
a letter</i>.' Not many words, <i>mon cher</i>, but confoundedly
comprehensive! And I who believed that girl to be an angel of
candor! I who was within an ace of falling seriously in love with
her! <i>Sacredie</i>! what an idiot I have been!"</p>
<p>"Forget her, my dear fellow," said I. "Wipe her out of your
memory (which I think will not be difficult), and leave her to her
fate."</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>"No," he said, gloomily, "I won't do that. I'll get to the
bottom of that man's mystery; and if, as I suspect, there's that
about his past life which won't bear the light of day--I'll save
her, if I can."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV."></a>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>
<h3>WEARY AND FAR DISTANT.</h3>
<br>
<p>Twice already, in accordance with my promise to Dalrymple, I had
called upon Madame de Courcelles, and finding her out each time,
had left my card, and gone away disappointed. From Dalrymple
himself, although I had written to him several times, I heard
seldom, and always briefly. His first notes were dated from Berlin,
and those succeeding them from Vienna. He seemed restless, bitter,
dissatisfied with himself, and with the world. Naturally unfit for
a lounging, idle life, his active nature, now that it had to bear
up against the irritation of hope deferred, chafed and fretted for
work.</p>
<p>"My sword-arm," he wrote in one of his letters, "is weary of its
holiday. There are times when I long for the smell of gunpowder,
and the thunder of battle. I am sick to death of churches and
picture-galleries, operas, dilettantism, white-kid-glovism, and all
the hollow shows and seemings of society. Sometimes I regret having
left the army--at others I rejoice; for, after all, in these piping
times of peace, to be a soldier is to be a mere painted puppet--a
thing of pipe-clay and gold bullion--an expensive scarecrow--an
elegant Guy Fawkes--a sign, not of what is, but of what has been,
and yet may be again. For my part, I care not to take the livery
without the service. Pshaw! will things never mend! Are the good
old times, and the good old international hatreds, gone by for
ever? Shall we never again have a thorough, seasonable, wholesome,
continental war? This place (Vienna) would be worth fighting for,
if one had the chance. I sometimes amuse myself by planning a
siege, when I ride round the fortifications, as is my custom of an
afternoon."</p>
<p>In another, after telling me that he had been reading some books
of travel in Egypt and Central America, he said:--</p>
<p>"Next to a military life I think that of a traveller--a genuine
traveller, who turns his back upon railroads and guides--must be
the most exciting and the most enviable under heaven. Since reading
these books, I dream of the jungle and the desert, and fancy that a
buffalo-hunt must be almost as fine sport as a charge of cavalry.
Oh, what a weary exile this is! I feel as if the very air were
stagnant around me, and I, like the accursed vessel that carried
the ancient mariner,--</p>
<blockquote>As idle as a painted ship,<br>
Upon a painted ocean.'"</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, though rarely, he mentioned Madame de Courcelles, and
then very guardedly: always as "Madame de Courcelles," and never as
his wife.</p>
<p>"That morning," he wrote, "comes back to me with all the
vagueness of a dream--you will know what morning I mean, and why it
fills so shadowy a page in the book of my memory. And it might as
well have been a dream, for aught of present peace or future hope
that it has brought me. I often think that I was selfish when I
exacted that pledge from her. I do not see of what good it can be
to either her or me, or in what sense I can be said to have gained
even the power to protect and serve her. Would that I were rich; or
that she and I were poor together, and dwelling far away in some
American wild, under the shade of primeval trees, the world
forgetting; by the world forgot! I should enjoy the life of a
Canadian settler--so free, so rational, so manly. How happy we
might be--she with her children, her garden, her books; I with my
dogs, my gun, my lands! What a curse it is, this spider's web of
civilization, that hems and cramps us in on every side, and from
which not all the armor of common-sense is sufficient to preserve
us!"</p>
<p>Sometimes he broke into a strain of forced gayety, more sad, to
my thinking, than the bitterest lamentations could have been.</p>
<p>"I wish to Heaven," he said, in one of his later letters--"I
wish to Heaven I had no heart, and no brain! I wish I was, like
some worthy people I know, a mere human zoophyte, consisting of
nothing but a mouth and a stomach. Only conceive how it must
simplify life when once one has succeeded in making a clean sweep
of all those finer emotions which harass more complicated
organisms! Enviable zoophytes, that live only to digest!--who would
not be of the brotherhood?"</p>
<p>In another he wrote:--</p>
<p>"I seem to have lived years in the last five or six weeks, and
to have grown suddenly old and cynical. Some French writer (I think
it is Alphonse Karr) says, 'Nothing in life is really great and
good, except what is not true. Man's greatest treasures are his
illusions.' Alas! my illusions have been dropping from me in
showers of late, like withered leaves in Autumn. The tree will be
bare as a gallows ere long, if these rough winds keep on blowing.
If only things would amuse me as of old! If there was still
excitement in play, and forgetfulness in wine, and novelty in
travel! But there is none--and all things alike are 'flat, stale,
and unprofitable,' The truth is, Damon, I want but one thing--and
wanting that, lack all."</p>
<p>Here is one more extract, and it shall be the last:--</p>
<p>"You ask me how I pass my days--in truth, wearily enough. I rise
with the dawn, but that is not very early in September; and I ride
for a couple of hours before breakfast. After breakfast I play
billiards in some public room, consume endless pipes, read the
papers, and so on. Later in the day I scowl through a
picture-gallery, or a string of studios; or take a pull up the
river; or start off upon a long, solitary objectless walk through
miles and miles of forest. Then comes dinner--the inevitable,
insufferable, interminable German table-d'h&ocirc;te dinner--and
then there is the evening to be got through somehow! Now and then I
drop in at a theatre, but generally take refuge in some plebeian
Lust Garten or Beer Hall, where amid clouds of tobacco-smoke, one
may listen to the best part-singing and zitter-playing in Europe.
And so my days drag by--who but myself knows how slowly? Truly,
Damon, there comes to every one of us, sooner or later, a time when
we say of life as Christopher Sly said of the comedy--''Tis an
excellent piece of work. Would 'twere done!'"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI."></a>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>
<h3>THE VICOMTE DE CAYLUS.</h3>
<br>
<p>It was after receiving the last of these letters that I hazarded
a third visit to Madame de Courcelles. This time, I ventured to
present myself at her door about midday, and was at once ushered
upstairs into a drawing-room looking out on the Rue Castellane.</p>
<p>Seeing her open work-table, with the empty chair and footstool
beside it, I thought at the first glance that I was alone in the
room, when a muttered "Sacr-r-r-re! Down, Bijou!" made me aware of
a gentleman extended at full length upon a sofa near the fireplace,
and of a vicious-looking Spitz crouched beneath it.</p>
<p>The gentleman lifted his head from the sofa-cusion; stared at
me; bowed carelessly; got upon his feet; and seizing the poker,
lunged savagely at the fire, as if he had a spite against it, and
would have put it out, if he could. This done, he yawned aloud,
flung himself into the nearest easy-chair, and rang the bell.</p>
<p>"More coals, Henri," he said, imperiously; "and--stop! a bottle
of Seltzer-water."</p>
<p>The servant hesitated.</p>
<p>"I don't think, Monsieur le Vicomte," he said, "that Madame has
any Seltzer-water in the house; but ..."</p>
<p>"Confound you!--you never have anything in the house at the
moment one wants it," interrupted the gentleman, irritably.</p>
<p>"I can send for some, if Monsieur le Vicomte desires it."</p>
<p>"Send for it, then; and remember, when I next ask for it, let
there be some at hand."</p>
<p>"Yes, Monsieur le Vicomte."</p>
<p>"And--Henri!"</p>
<p>"Yes, Monsieur le Vicomte."</p>
<p>"Bid them be quick. I hate to be kept waiting!"</p>
<p>The servant murmured his usual "Yes, Monsieur le Vicomte," and
disappeared; but with a look of such subdued dislike and impatience
in his face, as would scarcely have flattered Monsieur le Vicomte
had he chanced to surprise it.</p>
<p>In the meantime the dog had never ceased growling; whilst I, in
default of something better to do, turned over the leaves of an
album, and took advantage of a neighboring mirror to scrutinize the
outward appearance of this authoritative occupant of Madame de
Courcelles' drawing-room.</p>
<p>He was a small, pallid, slender man of about thirty-five or
seven years of age, with delicate, effeminate features, and hair
thickly sprinkled with gray. His fingers, white and taper as a
woman's, were covered with rings. His dress was careless, but that
of a gentleman. Glancing at him even thus furtively, I could not
help observing the worn lines about his temples, the mingled
languor and irritability of his every gesture; the restless
suspicion of his eye; the hard curves about his handsome mouth.</p>
<p>"<i>Mille tonnerres</i>!" said he, between his teeth "come out,
Bijou--come out, I say!"</p>
<p>The dog came out unwillingly, and changed the growl to a little
whine of apprehension. His master immediately dealt him a smart
kick that sent him crouching to the farther corner of the room,
where he hid himself under a chair.</p>
<p>"I'll teach you to make that noise," muttered he, as he drew his
chair closer to the fire, and bent over it, shiveringly. "A yelping
brute, that would be all the better for hanging."</p>
<p>Having sat thus for a few moments, he seemed to grow restless
again, and, pushing back his chair, rose, looked out of the window,
took a turn or two across the room, and paused at length to take a
book from one of the side-tables. As he did this, our eyes met in
the looking-glass; whereupon he turned hastily back to the window,
and stood there whistling till it occurred to him to ring the bell
again.</p>
<p>"Monsieur rang?" said the footman, once more making his
appearance at the door.</p>
<p>"<i>Mort de ma vie</i>! yes. The Seltzer-water."</p>
<p>"I have sent for it, Monsieur le Vicomte."</p>
<p>"And it is not yet come?"</p>
<p>"Not yet, Monsieur le Vicomte."</p>
<p>He muttered something to himself, and dropped back into the
chair before the fire.</p>
<p>"Does Madame de Courcelles know that I am here?" he asked, as
the servant, after lingering a moment, was about to leave the
room.</p>
<p>"I delivered Monsieur le Vicomte's message, and brought back
Madame's reply," said the man, "half an hour ago."</p>
<p>"True--I had forgotten it. You may go."</p>
<p>The footman closed the door noiselessly, and had no sooner done
so than he was recalled by another impatient peal.</p>
<p>"Here, Henri--have you told Madame de Courcelles that this
gentleman is also waiting to see her?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Monsieur le Vicomte."</p>
<p>"<i>Eh bien</i>?"</p>
<p>"And Madame said she should be down in a few moments."</p>
<p>"<i>Sacredie</i>! go back, then, and inquire if...."</p>
<p>"Madame is here."</p>
<p>As the footman moved back respectfully, Madame de Courcelles
came into the room. She was looking perhaps somewhat paler, but, to
my thinking, more charming than ever. Her dark hair was gathered
closely round her head in massive braids, displaying to their
utmost advantage all the delicate curves of her throat and chin;
while her rich morning dress, made of some dark material, and
fastened at the throat by a round brooch of dead gold, fell in
loose and ample folds, like the drapery of a Roman matron. Coming
at once to meet me, she extended a cordial hand, and said:--</p>
<p>"I had begun to despair of ever seeing you again. Why have you
always come when I was out?"</p>
<p>"Madame," I said, bending low over the slender fingers, that
seemed to linger kindly in my own, "I have been undeservedly
unfortunate."</p>
<p>"Remember for the future," she said, "that I am always at home
till midday, and after five."</p>
<p>Then, turning to her other visitor, she said:--</p>
<p>"<i>Mon cousin</i>, allow me to present my friend. Monsieur
Arbuthnot--Monsieur le Vicomte Adrien de Caylus."</p>
<p>I had suspected as much already. Who but he would have dared to
assume these airs of insolence? Who but her suitor and my friend's
rival? I had disliked him at first sight, and now I detested him.
Whether it was that my aversion showed itself in my face, or that
Madame de Courcelles's cordial welcome of myself annoyed him, I
know not; but his bow was even cooler than my own.</p>
<p>"I have been waiting to see you, Hel&egrave;ne," said he,
looking at his watch, "for nearly three-quarters of an hour."</p>
<p>"I sent you word, <i>mon cousin</i>, that I was finishing a
letter for the foreign post," said Madame de Courcelles, coldly,
"and that I could not come sooner."</p>
<p>Monsieur de Caylus bit his lip and cast an impatient glance in
my direction.</p>
<p>"Can you spare me a few moments alone, Hel&egrave;ne?" he
said.</p>
<p>"Alone, <i>mon cousin</i>?"</p>
<p>"Yes, upon a matter of business."</p>
<p>Madame de Courcelles sighed.</p>
<p>"If Monsieur Arbuthnot will be so indulgent as to excuse me for
five minutes," she replied. "This way, <i>mon cousin</i>."</p>
<p>So saying, she lifted a dark green curtain, beneath which they
passed to a farther room out of sight and hearing.</p>
<p>They remained a long time away. So long, that I grew weary of
waiting, and, having turned over all the illustrated books upon the
table, and examined every painting on the walls, turned to the
window, as the idler's last resource, and watched the
passers-by.</p>
<p>What endless entertainment in the life-tide of a Paris street,
even though but a branch from one of the greater arteries! What
color--what character--what animation--what variety! Every third or
fourth man is a blue-bloused artisan; every tenth, a soldier in a
showy uniform. Then comes the grisette in her white cap; and the
lemonade-vender with his fantastic pagoda, slung like a peep-show
across his shoulders; and the peasant woman from Normandy, with her
high-crowned head-dress; and the abb&eacute;, all in black, with
his shovel-hat pulled low over his eyes; and the mountebank selling
pencils and lucifer-matches to the music of a hurdy-gurdy; and the
gendarme, who is the terror of street urchins; and the gamin, who
is the torment of the gendarme; and the water-carrier, with his
cart and his cracked bugle; and the elegant ladies and gentlemen,
who look in at shop windows and hire seats at two sous each in the
Champs Elys&eacute;es; and, of course, the English tourist reading
"Galignani's Guide" as he goes along. Then, perhaps, a regiment
marches past with colors flying and trumpets braying; or a
fantastic-looking funeral goes by, with a hearse like a four-post
bed hung with black velvet and silver; or the peripatetic showman
with his company of white rats establishes himself on the pavement
opposite, till admonished to move on by the sergent de ville. What
an ever-shifting panorama! What a kaleidoscope of color and
character! What a study for the humorist, the painter, the
poet!</p>
<p>Thinking thus, and watching the overflowing current as it
hurried on below, I became aware of a smart cab drawn by a showy
chestnut, which dashed round the corner of the street and came down
the Rue Castellane at a pace that caused every head to turn as it
went by. Almost before I had time to do more than observe that it
was driven by a moustachioed and lavender-kidded gentleman, it drew
up before the house, and a trim tiger jumped down, and thundered at
the door. At that moment, the gentleman, taking advantage of the
pause to light a cigar, looked up, and I recognised the black
moustache and sinister countenance of Monsieur de Simoncourt.</p>
<p>"A gentleman for Monsieur le Vicomte," said the servant, drawing
back the green curtain and opening a vista into the room
beyond.</p>
<p>"Ask him to come upstairs," said the voice of De Caylus from
within.</p>
<p>"I have done so, Monsieur; but he prefers to wait in the
cabriolet."</p>
<p>"Pshaw!--confound it!--say that I'm coming."</p>
<p>The servant withdrew.</p>
<p>I then heard the words "perfectly safe investment--present
convenience--unexpected demand," rapidly uttered by Monsieur de
Caylus; and then they both came back; he looked flushed and
angry--she calm as ever.</p>
<p>"Then I shall call on you again to-morrow, Hel&egrave;ne," said
he, plucking nervously at his glove. "You will have had time to
reflect. You will see matters differently."</p>
<p>Madame Courcelles shook her head.</p>
<p>"Reflection will not change my opinion," she said gently.</p>
<p>"Well, shall I send Lejeune to you? He acts as solicitor to the
company, and ..."</p>
<p>"<i>Mon cousin</i>" interposed the lady, "I have already given
you my decision--why pursue the question further? I do not wish to
see Monsieur Lejeune, and I have no speculative tastes
whatever."</p>
<p>Monsieur de Caylus, with a suppressed exclamation that sounded
like a curse, rent his glove right in two, and then, as if annoyed
at the self-betrayal, crushed up the fragments in his hand, and
laughed uneasily.</p>
<p>"All women are alike," he said, with an impatient shrug. "They
know nothing of the world, and place no faith in those who are
competent to advise them. I had given you credit, my charming
cousin, for broader views."</p>
<p>Madame de Courcelles smiled without replying, and caressed the
little dog, which had come out from under the sofa to fondle round
her.</p>
<p>"Poor Bijou!" said she. "Pretty Bijou! Do you take good care of
him, <i>mon cousin</i>?"</p>
<p>"Upon my soul, not I," returned De Caylus, carelessly. "Lecroix
feeds him, I believe, and superintends his general education."</p>
<p>"Who is Lecroix?"</p>
<p>"My valet, courier, body-guard, letter-carrier, and general
<i>factotum</i>. A useful vagabond, without whom I should scarcely
know my right hand from my left!"</p>
<p>"Poor Bijou! I fear, then, your chance of being remembered is
small indeed!" said Madame de Courcelles, compassionately.</p>
<p>But Monsieur le Vicomte only whistled to the dog; bowed
haughtily to me; kissed, with an air of easy familiarity, before
which she evidently recoiled, first the hand and then the cheek of
his beautiful cousin, and so left the room. The next moment I saw
him spring into the cabriolet, take his place beside Monsieur de
Simoncourt, and drive away, with Bijou following at a pace that
might almost have tried a greyhound.</p>
<p>"My cousin, De Caylus, has lately returned from Algiers on leave
of absence," said Madame de Courcelles, after a few moments of
awkward silence, during which I had not known what to say. "You
have heard of him, perhaps?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Madame, I have heard of Monsieur de Caylus."</p>
<p>"From Captain Dalrymple?</p>
<p>"From Captain Dalrymple, Madame; and in society."</p>
<p>"He is a brave officer," she said, hesitatingly, "and has
greatly distinguished himself in this last campaign."</p>
<p>"So I have heard, Madame."</p>
<p>She looked at me, as if she would fain read how much or how
little Dalrymple had told me.</p>
<p>"You are Captain Dalrymple's friend, Mr. Arbuthnot," she said,
presently, "and I know you have his confidence. You are probably
aware that my present position with regard to Monsieur de Caylus is
not only very painful, but also very difficult."</p>
<p>"Madame, I know it."</p>
<p>"But it is a position of which I have the command, and which no
one understands so well as myself. To attempt to help me, would be
to add to my embarrassments. For this reason it is well that
Captain Dalrymple is not here. His presence just now in Paris could
do no good--on the contrary, would be certain to do harm. Do you
follow my meaning, Monsieur Arbuthnot?"</p>
<p>"I understand what you say, Madame; but...."</p>
<p>"But you do not quite understand why I say it? <i>Eh bien</i>,
Monsieur, when you write to Captain Dalrymple.... for you write
sometimes, do you not?"</p>
<p>"Often, Madame."</p>
<p>"Then, when you write, say nothing that may add to his
anxieties. If you have reason at any time to suppose that I am
importuned to do this or that; that I am annoyed; that I have my
own battle to fight--still, for his sake as well as for mine, be
silent. It <i>is</i> my own battle, and I know how to fight
it."</p>
<p>"Alas! Madame...."</p>
<p>She smiled sadly.</p>
<p>"Nay," she said, "I have more courage than you would suppose;
more courage and more will. I am fully capable of bearing my own
burdens; and Captain Dalrymple has already enough of his own. Now
tell me something of yourself. You are here, I think, to study
medicine. Are you greatly devoted to your work? Have you many
friends?"</p>
<p>"I study, Madame--not always very regularly; and I have one
friend."</p>
<p>"An Englishman?"</p>
<p>"No, Madame--a German."</p>
<p>"A fellow-student, I presume."</p>
<p>"No, Madame--an artist."</p>
<p>"And you are very happy here?"</p>
<p>"I have occupations and amusements; therefore, if to be neither
idle nor dull is to be happy. I suppose I am happy."</p>
<p>"Nay," she said quickly, "be sure of it. Do not doubt it. Who
asks more from Fate courts his own destruction."</p>
<p>"But it would be difficult, Madame, to go through life without
desiring something better, something higher--without ambition, for
instance--without love."</p>
<p>"Ambition and love!" she repeated, smiling sadly. "There speaks
the man. Ambition first--the aim and end of life; love next--the
pleasant adjunct to success! Ah, beware of both."</p>
<p>"But without either, life would be a desert."</p>
<p>"Life <i>is</i> a desert," she replied, bitterly. "Ambition is
its mirage, ever beckoning, ever receding--love its Dead Sea fruit,
fair without and dust within. You look surprised. You did not
expect such gloomy theories from me--yet I am no cynic. I have
lived; I have suffered; I am a woman--<i>voil&agrave; tout</i>.
When you are a few years older, and have trodden some of the flinty
ways of life, you will see the world as I see it."</p>
<p>"It may be so, Madame; but if life is indeed a desert, it is, at
all events, some satisfaction to know that the dwellers in tents
become enamored of their lot, and, content with what the desert has
to give, desire no other. It is only the neophyte who rides after
the mirage and thirsts for the Dead Sea apple."</p>
<p>She smiled again.</p>
<p>"Ah!" she said, "the gifts of the desert are two-fold, and what
one gets depends on what one seeks. For some the wilderness has
gifts of resignation, meditation, peace; for others it has the
horse, the tent, the pipe, the gun, the chase of the panther and
antelope. But to go back to yourself. Life, you say, would be
barren without ambition and love. What is your ambition?"</p>
<p>"Nay, Madame, that is more than I can tell you--more than I know
myself."</p>
<p>"Your profession...."</p>
<p>"If ever I dream dreams, Madame," I interrupted quickly, "my
profession has no share in them. It is a profession I do not love,
and which I hope some day to abandon."</p>
<p>"Your dreams, then?"</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>"Vague--unsubstantial--illusory--forgotten as soon as dreamt!
How can I analyze them? How can I describe them? In childhood one
says--'I should like to be a soldier, and conquer the world;' or 'I
should like to be a sailor, and discover new Continents;' or 'I
should like to be a poet, and wear a laurel wreath, like Petrarch
and Dante;' but as one gets older and wiser (conscious, perhaps, of
certain latent energies, and weary of certain present difficulties
and restraints), one can only wait, as best one may, and watch for
the rising of that tide whose flood leads on to fortune."</p>
<p>With this I rose to take my leave. Madame de Courcelles smiled
and put out her hand.</p>
<p>"Come often," she said; "and come at the hours when I am at
home. I shall always be glad to see you. Above all, remember my
caution--not a word to Captain Dalrymple, either now or at any
other time."</p>
<p>"Madame, you may rely upon me. One thing I ask, however, as the
reward of my discretion."</p>
<p>"And that one thing?"</p>
<p>"Permission, Madame, to serve you in any capacity, however
humble--in any strait where a brother might interfere, or a
faithful retainer lay down his life in your service."</p>
<p>With a sweet earnestness that made my heart beat and my cheeks
glow, she thanked and promised me.</p>
<p>"I shall look upon you henceforth," she said, "as my knight
<i>sans peur et sans reproche</i>."</p>
<p>Heaven knows that not all the lessons of all the moralists that
ever wrote or preached since the world began, could just then have
done me half such good service as did those simple words. They came
at the moment when I most needed them--when I had almost lost my
taste for society, and was sliding day by day into habits of more
confirmed idleness and Bohemianism. They roused me. They made a man
of me. They recalled me to higher aims, "purer manners, nobler
laws." They clothed me, so to speak, in the <i>toga virilis</i> of
a generous devotion. They made me long to prove myself "<i>sans
peur</i>," to merit the "<i>sans reproche."</i> They marked an era
in my life never to be forgotten or effaced.</p>
<p>Let it not be thought for one moment that I loved her--or
fancied I loved her. No, not so far as one heart-beat would carry
me; but I was proud to possess her confidence and her friendship.
Was she not Dalrymple's wife, and had not he asked me to watch over
and protect her? Nay, had she not called me her knight and accepted
my fealty?</p>
<p>Nothing perhaps, is so invaluable to a young man on entering
life as the friendship of a pure-minded and highly-cultivated woman
who, removed too far above him to be regarded with passion, is yet
beautiful enough to engage his admiration; whose good opinion
becomes the measure of his own self-respect; and whose confidence
is a sacred trust only to be parted from with loss of life or
honor.</p>
<p>Such an influence upon myself at this time was the friendship of
Madame de Courcelles. I went out from her presence that morning
morally stronger than before, and at each repetition of my visit I
found her influence strengthen and increase. Sometimes I met
Monsieur de Caylus, on which occasions my stay was ever of the
briefest; but I most frequently found her alone, and then our talk
was of books, of art, of culture, of all those high and stirring
things that alike move the sympathies of the educated woman and
rouse the enthusiasm of the young man. She became interested in me;
at first for Dalrymple's sake, and by-and-by, however little I
deserved it, for my own--and she showed that interest in many ways
inexpressibly valuable to me then and thenceforth. She took pains
to educate my taste; opened to me hitherto unknown avenues of
study; led me to explore "fresh fields and pastures new," to which,
but for her help, I might not have found my way for many a year to
come. My reading, till now, had been almost wholly English or
classical; she sent me to the old French literature--to the
<i>Chansons de Geste</i>; to the metrical romances of the
Trouv&egrave;res; to the Chronicles of Froissart, Monstrelet, and
Philip de Comines, and to the poets and dramatists that immediately
succeeded them.</p>
<p>These books opened a new world to me; and, having daily access
to two fine public libraries, I plunged at once into a course of
new and delightful reading, ranging over all that fertile tract of
song and history that begins far away in the morning land of
medi&aelig;val romance, and leads on, century after century, to the
new era that began with the Revolution.</p>
<p>With what avidity I devoured those picturesque old
chronicles--those autobiographies--those poems, and satires, and
plays that I now read for the first time! What evenings I spent
with St. Simon, and De Thou, and Charlotte de Bavi&egrave;re! How I
relished Voltaire! How I laughed over Moli&egrave;re! How I
revelled in Montaigne! Most of all, however, I loved the quaint
lore of the earlier literature:--</p>
<blockquote>"Old legends of the monkish page,<br>
&nbsp;Traditions of the saint and sage,<br>
&nbsp;Tales that have the rime of age,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Chronicles of Eld."</blockquote>
<p>Nor was this all. I had hitherto loved art as a child or a
savage might love it, ignorantly, half-blindly, without any
knowledge of its principles, its purposes, or its history. But
Madame de Courcelles put into my hands certain books that opened my
eyes to a thousand wonders unseen before. The works of Vasari,
Nibby, Winkelman and Lessing, the aesthetic writings of Goethe and
the Schlegels, awakened in me, one after the other, fresher and
deeper revelations of beauty.</p>
<p>I wandered through the galleries of the Louvre like one newly
gifted with sight. I haunted the Venus of Milo and the Diane
Chasseresse like another Pygmalion. The more I admired, the more I
found to admire. The more I comprehended, the more I found there
remained for me to comprehend. I recognised in art the Sphinx whose
enigma is never solved. I learned, for the first time, that poetry
may be committed to imperishable marble, and steeped in unfading
colors. By degrees, as I followed in the footsteps of great
thinkers, my insight became keener and my perceptions more refined.
The symbolism of art evolved itself, as it were, from below the
surface; and instead of beholding in paintings and statues mere
studies of outward beauty, I came to know them as exponents of
thought--as efforts after ideal truth--as aspirations which,
because of their divineness, can never be wholly expressed; but
whose suggestiveness is more eloquent than all the eloquence of
words.</p>
<p>Thus a great change came upon my life--imperceptibly at first,
and by gradual degrees; but deeply and surely. To apply myself to
the study of medicine became daily more difficult and more
distasteful to me. The boisterous pleasures of the Quartier Latin
lost their charm for me. Day by day I gave myself up more and more
passionately to the cultivation of my taste for poetry and art. I
filled my little sitting-room with casts after the antique. I
bought some good engravings for my walls, and hung up a copy of the
Madonna di San Sisto above the table at which I wrote and read. All
day long, wherever I might be--at the hospital, in the
lecture-room, in the laboratory--I kept looking longingly forward
to the quiet evening by-and-by when, with shaded lamp and curtained
window, I should again take up the studies of the night before.</p>
<p>Thus new aims opened out before me, and my thoughts flowed into
channels ever wider and deeper. Already the first effervescence of
youth seemed to have died off the surface of my life, as the
"beaded bubbles" die off the surface of champagne. I had tried
society, and wearied of it. I had tried Bohemia, and found it
almost as empty as the Chauss&eacute;e d'Autin. And now that life
which from boyhood I had ever looked upon as the happiest on earth,
the life of the student, was mine. Could I have devoted it wholly
and undividedly to those pursuits which were fast becoming to me as
the life of my life, I would not have exchanged my lot for all the
wealth of the Rothschilds. Somewhat indolent, perhaps, by nature,
indifferent to achieve, ambitious only to acquire, I asked nothing
better than a life given up to the worship of all that is beautiful
in art, to the acquisition of knowledge, and to the development of
taste. Would the time ever come when I might realize my dream? Ah!
who could tell? In the meanwhile ... well, in the meanwhile, here
was Paris--here were books, museums, galleries, schools, golden
opportunities which, once past, might never come again. So I
reasoned; so time went on; so I lived, plodding on by day in the
&Eacute;cole de M&eacute;decine, but, when evening came, resuming
my studies at the leaf turned down the night before, and, like the
visionary in "The Pilgrims of the Rhine," taking up my dream-life
at the point where I had been last awakened.</p>

<h3>GUICHET THE MODEL.</h3>
<br>
<p>To the man who lives alone and walks about with his eyes open,
the mere bricks and mortar of a great city are instinct with
character. Buildings become to him like living creatures. The
streets tell him tales. For him, the house-fronts are written over
with hieroglyphics which, to the passing crowd, are either unseen
or without meaning. Fallen grandeur, pretentious gentility, decent
poverty, the infamy that wears a brazen front, and the crime that
burrows in darkness--he knows them all at a glance. The patched
window, the dingy blind, the shattered doorstep, the pot of
mignonette on the garret ledge, are to him as significant as the
lines and wrinkles on a human face. He grows to like some houses
and to dislike others, almost without knowing why--just as one
grows to like or dislike certain faces in the parks and clubs. I
remember now, as well as if it were yesterday, how, during the
first weeks of my life in Paris, I fell in love at first sight with
a wee <i>maisonnette</i> at the corner of a certain street
overlooking the Luxembourg gardens--a tiny little house, with
soft-looking blue silk window-curtains, and cream-colored
jalousies, and boxes of red and white geraniums at all the windows.
I never knew who lived in that sunny little nest; I never saw a
face at any of those windows; yet I used to go out of my way in the
summer evenings to look at it, as one might go to look at a
beautiful woman behind a stall in the market-place, or at a Madonna
in a shop-window.</p>
<p>At the time about which I write, there was probably no city in
Europe of which the street-scenery was so interesting as that of
Paris. I have already described the Quartier Latin, joyous,
fantastic, out-at-elbows; a world in itself and by itself; unlike
anything else in Paris or elsewhere. But there were other districts
in the great city--now swept away and forgotten--as characteristic
in their way as the Quartier Latin. There was the He de Saint
Louis, for instance--a <i>Campo Santo</i> of decayed
nobility--lonely, silent, fallen upon evil days, and haunted here
and there by ghosts of departed Marquises and Abb&eacute;s of the
<i>vieille &eacute;cole</i>. There was the debateable land to the
rear of the Invalides and the Champ de Mars. There was the Faubourg
St. Germain, fast falling into the sere and yellow leaf, and going
the way of the Ile de Saint Louis. There was the neighborhood of
the Boulevart d'Aulnay, and the Rue de la Roquette, ghastly with
the trades of death; a whole Quartier of monumental sculptors,
makers of iron crosses, weavers of funereal chaplets, and wholesale
coffin-factors. And beside and apart from all this, there were (as
in all great cities) districts of evil report and obscure
topography--lost islets of crime, round which flowed and circled
the daily tide of Paris life; flowed and circled, yet never
penetrated. A dark arch here and there--the mouth of a foul
alley--a riverside vista of gloom and squalor, marked the entrance
to these Alsatias. Such an Alsatia was the Rue Pierre Lescot, the
Rue Sans Nom, and many more than I can now remember--streets into
which no sane man would venture after nightfall without the escort
of the police.</p>
<p>Into the border land of such a neighborhood--a certain congeries
of obscure and labyrinthine streets to the rear of the old
Halles--I accompanied Franz M&uuml;ller one wintry afternoon, about
an hour before sunset, and perhaps some ten days after our evening
in the Rue du Faubourg St. Denis. We were bound on an expedition of
discovery, and the object of our journey was to find the habitat of
Guichet the model.</p>
<p>"I am determined to get to the bottom of this Lenoir business,"
said M&uuml;ller, doggedly; "and if the police won't help me, I
must help myself."</p>
<p>"You have no case for the police," I replied.</p>
<p>"So says the <i>chef de bureau</i>; but I am of the opposite
opinion. However, I shall make my case out clearly enough before
long. This Guichet can help me, if he will. He knows Lenoir, and he
knows something against him; that is clear. You saw how cautious he
was the other day. The difficulty will be to make him speak."</p>
<p>"I doubt if you will succeed."</p>
<p>"I don't, <i>mon cher</i>. But we shall see. Then, again, I have
another line of evidence open to me. You remember that
orange-colored rosette in the fellow's button-hole?"</p>
<p>"Certainly I do."</p>
<p>"Well, now, I happen, by the merest chance, to know what that
rosette means. It is the ribbon of the third order of the Golden
Palm of Mozambique--a Portuguese decoration. They give it to
diplomatic officials, eminent civilians, distinguished foreigners,
and the like. I know a fellow who has it, and who belongs to the
Portuguese Legation here. <i>Eh bien!</i> I went to him the other
day, and asked him about our said friend--how he came by it, who he
is, where he comes from, and so forth. My Portuguese repeats the
name--elevates his eyebrows--in short, has never heard of such a
person. Then he pulls down a big book from a shelf in the
secretary's room--turns to a page headed 'Golden Palm of
Mozambique'--runs his finger along the list of names--shakes his
head, and informs me that no Lenoir is, or ever has been, received
into the order. What do you say to that, now?"</p>
<p>"It is just what I should have expected; but still it is not a
ease for the police. It concerns the Portuguese minister; and the
Portuguese minister is by no means likely to take any trouble about
the matter. But why waste all this time and care? If I were you, I
would let the thing drop. It is not worth the cost."</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller looked grave.</p>
<p>"I would drop it this moment," he said, "if--if it were not for
the girl."</p>
<p>"Who is still less worth the cost,"</p>
<p>"I know it," he replied, impatiently. "She has a pretty,
sentimental Madonna face; a sweet voice; a gentle manner--<i>et
voil&agrave; tout</i>. I'm not the least bit in love with her now.
I might have been. I might have committed some great folly for her
sake; but that danger is past, <i>Dieu merci!</i> I couldn't love a
girl I couldn't trust, and that girl is a flirt. A flirt of the
worst sort, too--demure, serious, conventional. No, no; my fancy
for the fair Marie has evaporated; but, for all that, I don't
relish the thought of what her fate might be if linked for life to
an unscrupulous scoundrel like Lenoir. I must do what I can, my
dear fellow--I must do what I can."</p>
<p>We had by this time rounded the Halles, and were threading our
way through one gloomy by-street after another. The air was chill,
the sky low and rainy; and already the yellow glow of an oil-lamp
might be seen gleaming through the inner darkness of some of the
smaller shops. Meanwhile, the dusk seemed to gather at our heels,
and to thicken at every step.</p>
<p>"You are sure you know your way?" I asked presently, seeing
M&uuml;ller look up at the name at the corner of the street.</p>
<p>"Why, yes; I think I do," he answered, doubtfully.</p>
<p>"Why not inquire of that man just ahead?" I suggested.</p>
<p>He was a square-built, burly, shabby-looking fellow, and was
striding along so fast that we had to quicken our pace in order to
come up with him. All at once M&uuml;ller fell back, laid his hand
on my arm, and said:--</p>
<p>"Stop! It is Guichet himself. Let him go on, and we'll
follow."</p>
<p>So we dropped into the rear and followed him. He turned
presently to the right, and preceded us down a long and horribly
ill-favored street, full of mean cabarets and lodging-houses of the
poorest class, where, painted in red letters on broken lamps above
the doors, or printed on cards wafered against the window-panes,
one saw at almost every other house, the words, "<i>Ici on loge la
nuit</i>." At the end of this thoroughfare our unconscious guide
plunged into a still darker and fouler <i>impasse</i>, hung across
from side to side with rows of dingy linen, and ornamented in the
centre with a mound of decaying cabbage-leaves, potato-parings,
oyster-shells, and the like. Here he made for a large tumble-down
house that closed the alley at the farther end, and, still followed
by ourselves, went in at an open doorway, and up a public staircase
dimly lighted by a flickering oil-lamp at every landing. At his own
door he paused, and just as he had turned the key, M&uuml;ller
accosted him.</p>
<p>"Is that you, Guichet?" he said. "Why, you are the very man I
want! If I had come ten minutes sooner, I should have missed
you."</p>
<p>"Is it M'sieur M&uuml;ller?" said Guichet, bending his heavy
brows and staring at us in the gloom of the landing.</p>
<p>"Ay, and with me the friend you saw the other day. So, this is
your den? May we come in?"</p>
<p>He had been standing till now with his hand on the key and the
closed door at his back, evidently not intending to admit us; but
thus asked, he pushed the door open, and said, somewhat
ungraciously:--</p>
<p>"It is just that, M'sieur M&uuml;ller--a den; not fit for
gentlemen like you. But you can go in, if you please."</p>
<p>We did not wait for a second invitation, but went in
immediately. It was a long, low, dark room, with a pale gleam of
fading daylight struggling in through a tiny window at the farther
end. We could see nothing at first but this gleam; and it was not
till Guichet had raked out the wood ashes on the hearth, and blown
them into a red glow with his breath, that we could distinguish the
form or position of anything in the room. Then, by the flicker of
the fire, we saw a low truckle-bed close under the window; a kind
of bruised and battered seaman's chest in the middle of the room; a
heap of firewood in one corner; a pile of old packing-cases; old
sail-cloth, old iron, and all kinds of rubbish in another; a few
pots and pans over the fire-place; and a dilapidated stool or two
standing about the room. Avoiding these latter, we set ourselves
down upon the edge of the chest; while Guichet, having by this time
lit a piece of candle-end in a tin sconce against the wall, stood
before us with folded arms, and stared at us in silence.</p>
<p>"I want to know, Guichet, if you can give me some sittings,"
said M&uuml;ller, by way of opening the conversation.</p>
<p>"Depends on when, M'sieur M&uuml;ller," growled the model.</p>
<p>"Well--next week, for the whole week."</p>
<p>Guichet shook his head. He was engaged to Monsieur Flandrin
<i>l&agrave; bas</i>, for the next month, from twelve to three
daily, and had only his mornings and evenings to dispose of; in
proof of which he pulled out a greasy note-book and showed where
the agreement was formally entered. M&uuml;ller made a grimace of
disappointment.</p>
<p>"That man's head takes a deal of cutting off, <i>mon ami</i>,"
he said. "Aren't you tired of playing executioner so long?"</p>
<p>"Not I, M'sieur! It's all the same to me--executioner or victim,
saint or devil."</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller, laughing, offered him a cigar.</p>
<p>"You've posed for some queer characters in your time, Guichet,"
said he.</p>
<p>"Parbleu, M'sieur!"</p>
<p>"But you've not been a model all your life?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps not, M'sieur."</p>
<p>"You've been a sailor once upon a time, haven't you?"</p>
<p>The model looked up quickly.</p>
<p>"How did you know that?" he said, frowning.</p>
<p>"By a number of little things--by this, for instance," replied
M&uuml;ller, kicking his heels against the sea-chest; "by certain
words you make use of now and then; by the way you walk; by the way
you tie your cravat. <i>Que diable</i>! you look at me as if you
took me for a sorcerer!"</p>
<p>The model shook his head.</p>
<p>"I don't understand it," he said, slowly.</p>
<p>"Nay, I could tell you more than that if I liked," said
M&uuml;ller, with an air of mystery.</p>
<p>"About myself?"</p>
<p>"Ay, about yourself, and others."</p>
<p>Guichet, having just lighted his cigar, forgot to put it to his
lips.</p>
<p>"What others?" he asked, with a look half of dull bewilderment
and half of apprehension.</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>"Pshaw!" said he; "I know more than you think I know, Guichet.
There's our friend, you know--he of whom I made the head t'other
day ... you remember?"</p>
<p>The model, still looking at him, made no answer.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you say at once where you had met him, and all the
rest of it, <i>mon vieux</i>? You might have been sure I should
find out for myself, sooner or later."</p>
<p>The model turned abruptly towards the fire-place, and, leaning
his head against the mantel-shelf, stood with his back towards us,
looking down into the fire.</p>
<p>"You ask me why I did not tell you at once?" he said, very
slowly.</p>
<p>"Ay--why not?"</p>
<p>"Why not? Because--because when a man has begun to lead an
honest life, and has gone on leading an honest life, as I have, for
years, he is glad to put the past behind him--to forget it, and all
belonging to it. How was I to guess you knew anything about--about
that place <i>l&agrave; bas</i>?"</p>
<p>"And why should I not know about it?" replied M&uuml;ller,
flashing a rapid glance at me.</p>
<p>Guichet was silent.</p>
<p>"What if I tell you that I am particularly interested in--that
place <i>l&agrave; bas</i>?"</p>
<p>"Well, that may be. People used to come sometimes, I
remember--artists and writers, and so on."</p>
<p>"Naturally."</p>
<p>"But I don't remember to have ever seen you, M'sieur
M&uuml;ller."</p>
<p>"You did not observe me, <i>mon cher</i>--or it may have been
before, or after your time."</p>
<p>"Yes, that's true," replied Guichet, ponderingly. "How long ago
was it, M'sieur M&uuml;ller?"</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller glanced at me again. His game, hitherto so easy, was
beginning to grow difficult.</p>
<p>"Eh, <i>mon Dieu</i>!" he said, indifferently, "how can I tell?
I have knocked about too much, now here, now there, in the course
of my life, to remember in what particular year this or that event
may have happened. I am not good at dates, and never was."</p>
<p>"But you remember seeing me there?"</p>
<p>"Have I not said so?"</p>
<p>Guichet took a couple of turns about the room. He looked flushed
and embarrassed.</p>
<p>"There is one thing I should like to know," he said, abruptly.
"Where was I? What was I doing when you saw me?"</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller was at fault now, for the first time.</p>
<p>"Where were you?" he repeated. "Why, there--where we said just
now. <i>L&agrave; bas</i>."</p>
<p>"No, no--that's not what I mean. Was I .... was I in the uniform
of the Garde Chiourme?"</p>
<p>The color rushed into M&uuml;ller's face as, flashing a glance
of exultation at me, he replied:--</p>
<p>"Assuredly, <i>mon ami</i>. In that, and no other."</p>
<p>The model drew a deep breath.</p>
<p>"And Bras de Fer?" he said. "Was he working in the quarries
?"</p>
<p>"Bras de Fer! Was that the name he went by in those days?"</p>
<p>"Ay--Bras de Fer--<i>alias</i> Coupe-gorge--<i>alias</i>
Triphot--<i>alias</i> Lenoir--<i>alias</i> a hundred other names.
Bras de Fer was the one he went by at Toulon--and a real devil he
was in the Bagnes! He escaped three times, and was twice caught and
brought back again. The third time he killed one sentry, injured
another for life, and got clear off. That was five years ago, and I
left soon after. I suppose, if you saw him in Paris the other day,
he has kept clear of Toulon ever since."</p>
<p>"But was he in for life?" said M&uuml;ller, eagerly.</p>
<p>"<i>Travaux forc&eacute;s &agrave;
perp&eacute;tuit&eacute;</i>," replied Guichet, touching his own
shoulder significantly with the thumb of his right hand.</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller sprang to his feet.</p>
<p>"Enough," he said. "That is all I wanted to know. Guichet,
<i>mon cher</i>, I am your debtor for life. We will talk about the
sittings when you have more time to dispose of. Adieu."</p>
<p>"But, M'sieur M&uuml;ller, you won't get me into trouble!"
exclaimed the model, eagerly. "You won't make any use of my
words?"</p>
<p>"Why, supposing I went direct to the Pr&eacute;fecture, what
trouble could I possibly get you into, <i>mon ami?</i>" replied
M&uuml;ller.</p>
<p>The model looked down in silence.</p>
<p>"You are a brave man. You do not fear the vengeance of Bras de
Fer, or his friends?"</p>
<p>"No, M'sieur---it's not that."</p>
<p>"What is it, then?"</p>
<p>"M'sieur...."</p>
<p>"Pshaw, man! Speak up."</p>
<p>"It is not that you would get me personally into trouble,
M'sieur M&uuml;ller," said Guichet, slowly. "I am no coward, I
hope--a coward would make a bad Garde Chiourme at Toulon, I fancy.
And I'm not an escaped <i>for&ccedil;at</i>. But--but, you see,
I've worked my way into a connection here in Paris, and I've made
myself a good name among the artists, and ... and I hold to that
good name above everything in the world."</p>
<p>"Naturally--rightly. But what has that to do with Lenoir?"</p>
<p>"Ah, M'sieur M&uuml;ller, if you knew more about me, you would
not need telling how much it has to do with him! I was not always a
Garde Chiourme at Toulon. I was promoted to it after a time, for
good conduct, you know, and that sort of thing. But--but I began
differently--I began by wearing the prison dress, and working in
the quarries."</p>
<p>"My good fellow," said M&uuml;ller, gently, "I half suspected
this--I am not surprised; and I respect you for having redeemed
that past in the way you have redeemed it."</p>
<p>"Thank you, M'sieur M&uuml;ller; but you see, redeemed or
unredeemed, I'd rather be lying at the bottom of the Seine than
have it rise up against me now,"</p>
<p>"We are men of honor," said M&uuml;ller, "and your secret is
safe with us."</p>
<p>"Not if you go to the Pr&eacute;fecture and inform against Bras
de Fer on my words," exclaimed the model, eagerly. "How can I
appear against him--Guichet the model--Guichet the Garde
Chiourme--Guichet the <i>for&ccedil;at?</i> M'sieur M&uuml;ller, I
could never hold my head up again. It would be the ruin of me."</p>
<p>"You shall not appear against him, and it shall not be the ruin
of you. Guichet," said M&uuml;ller. "That I promise you. Only
assure me that what you have said is strictly correct--that Bras de
Fer and Lenoir are one and the same person--an escaped
<i>for&ccedil;at</i>, condemned for life to the galleys."</p>
<p>"That's as true, M'sieur M&uuml;ller, as that God is in heaven,"
said the model, emphatically.</p>
<p>"Then I can prove it without your testimony--I can prove it by
simply summoning any of the Toulon authorities to identify
him."</p>
<p>"Or by stripping his shirt off his back, and showing the brand
on his left shoulder," said Guichet. "There you'll find it, T.F. as
large as life--and if it don't show at first, just you hit him a
sharp blow with the flat of your hand, M'sieur M&uuml;ller, and it
will start out as red and fresh as if it had been done only six
months ago. <i>Parbleu!</i> I remember the day he came in, and the
look in his face when the hot iron hissed into his flesh! They roar
like bulls, for the most part; but he never flinched or spoke. He
just turned a shade paler under the tan, and that was all."</p>
<p>"Do you remember what his crime was?" asked M&uuml;ller</p>
<p>Guichet shook his head.</p>
<p>"Not distinctly," he said. "I only know that he was in for a
good deal, and had a lot of things proved against him on his trial.
But you can find all that out for yourself, easily enough. He was
tried in Paris, about fourteen years ago, and it's all in print, if
you only know where to look for it."</p>
<p>"Then I'll find it, if I have to wade through half the
Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale!" said M&uuml;ller. "Adieu,
Guichet--you have done me a great service, and you may be sure I
will do nothing to betray you. Let us shake hands upon it."</p>
<p>The color rushed into the model's swarthy cheeks.</p>
<p>"<i>Comment</i>, M'sieur M&uuml;ller!" he said, hesitatingly.
"You offer to shake hands with me--after what I have told you?"</p>
<p>"Ten times more willing than before, <i>mon ami</i>," said
M&uuml;ller. "Did I not tell you just now that I respected you for
having redeemed that past, and shall I not give my hand where I
give my respect?"</p>
<p>The model grasped his outstretched hand with a vehemence that
made M&uuml;ller wince again.</p>
<p>"Thank you," he said, in a low, deep voice. "Thank you. Death of
my life! M'sieur M&uuml;ller, I'd go to the galleys again for you,
after this--if you asked me."</p>
<p>"Agreed. Only when I do ask you, it shall be to pay a visit of
ceremony to Monsieur Bras de Fer, when he is safely lodged again at
Toulon with a chain round his leg, and a cannon-ball at the end of
it."</p>
<p>And with this M&uuml;ller turned away laughingly, and I followed
him down the dimly-lighted stairs.</p>
<p>"By Jove!" he said, "what a grip the fellow gave me! I'd as soon
shake hands with the Commendatore in Don Giovanni."</p>

<h3>NUMBER TWO HUNDRED AND SEVEN.</h3>
<br>
<p>M&uuml;ller, when he so confidently proposed to visit Bras de
Fer in his future retirement at Toulon, believed that he had only
to lodge his information with the proper authorities, and see the
whole affair settled out of hand. He had not taken the bureaucratic
system into consideration; and he had forgotten how little positive
evidence he had to offer. It was no easier then than now to inspire
the official mind with either insight or decision; and the police
of Paris, inasmuch as they in no wise differed from the police of
to-day, yesterday, or to-morrow, were slow to understand, slow to
believe, and slower still to act.</p>
<p>An escaped convict? Monsieur le Chef du Bureau, upon whom we
took the liberty of waiting the next morning, could scarcely take
in the bare possibility of such a fact. An escaped convict? Bah! no
convict could possibly escape under the present admirable system.
<i>Comment</i>! He effected his escape some years ago? How many
years ago? In what yard, in what ward, under what number was he
entered in the official books? For what offence was he convicted?
Had Monsieur seen him at Toulon?--and was Monsieur prepared to
swear that Lenoir and Bras de Fer were one and the same person?
How! Monsieur proposed to identify a certain individual, and yet
was incapable of replying to these questions! Would Monsieur be
pleased to state upon what grounds he undertook to denounce the
said individual, and what proof he was prepared to produce in
confirmation of the same?</p>
<p>To all which official catechizing, M&uuml;ller, who (wanting
Guichet's testimony) had nothing but his intense personal
conviction to put forward, could only reply that he was ready to
pledge himself to the accuracy of his information; and that if
Monsieur the Chef du Bureau would be at the pains to call in any
Toulon official of a few years' standing, he would undoubtedly find
that the person now described as calling himself Lenoir, and the
person commonly known in the Bagnes as Bras de Fer, were indeed
"one and the same."</p>
<p>Whereupon Monsieur le Chef--a pompous personage, with a bald
head and a white moustache--shrugged his shoulders, smiled
incredulously, had the honor to point out to Monsieur that the
Government could by no means be at the expense of conveying an
inspector from Toulon to Paris on so shadowy and unsupported a
statement, and politely bowed us out.</p>
<p>Thus rebuffed, M&uuml;ller began to despair of present success;
whilst I, in default of any brighter idea, proposed that he should
take legal advice on the subject. So we went to a certain avocat,
in a little street adjoining the &Eacute;cole de Droit, and there
purchased as much wisdom as might be bought for the sum of five
francs sterling.</p>
<p>The avocat, happily, was fertile in suggestions. This, he said,
was not a case for a witness. Here was no question of appearing
before a court. With the foregone offences of either Lenoir or Bras
de Fer, we had nothing to do; and to convict them of such offences
formed no part of our plan. We only sought to show that Lenoir and
Bras de Fer were in truth "one and the same person," and we could
only do so upon the authority of some third party who had seen
both. Now Monsieur M&uuml;ller had seen Lenoir, but not Bras de
Fer; and Guichet had seen Bras de Fer, but not Lenoir. Here, then,
was the real difficulty; and here, he hoped, its obvious solution.
Let Guichet be taken to some place where, being himself unseen, he
may obtain a glimpse of Lenoir. This done, he can, in a private
interview of two minutes, state his conviction to Monsieur the Chef
de Bureau--<i>voil&agrave; tout</i>! If, however, the said Guichet
can be persuaded by no considerations either of interest or
justice, then another very simple course remains open. Every
newly-arrived convict in every penal establishment throughout
France is photographed on his entrance into the Bagne, and these
photographs are duly preserved for purposes of identification like
the present. Supposing therefore Bras de Fer had not escaped from
Toulon before the introduction of this system, his portrait would
exist in the official books to this day, and might doubtless be
obtained, if proper application were made through an official
channel.</p>
<p>Armed with this information, and knowing that any attempt to
induce Guichet to move further in the matter would be useless, we
then went back to the Bureau, and with much difficulty succeeded in
persuading M. le Chef to send to Toulon for the photograph. This
done, we could only wait and be patient.</p>
<p>Briefly, then, we did wait and were patient--though the last
condition was not easy; for even I, who was by no means disposed to
sympathize with M&uuml;ller in his solicitude for the fair Marie,
could not but feel a strange contagion of excitement in this
<i>chasse au for&ccedil;at</i>. And so a week or ten days went by,
till one memorable afternoon, when M&uuml;ller came rushing round
to my rooms in hot haste, about an hour before the time when we
usually met to go to dinner, and greeted me with--</p>
<p>"Good news, <i>mon vieux</i>! good news! The photograph has
come--and I have been to the Bureau to see it--and I have
identified my man--and he will be arrested to-night, as surely as
that he carries T.F. on his shoulder!"</p>
<p>"You are certain he is the same?" I said.</p>
<p>"As certain as I am of my own face when I see it in the
looking-glass."</p>
<p>And then he went on to say that a party of soldiers were to be
in readiness a couple of hours hence, in a shop commanding Madame
Mar&ocirc;t's door; that he, M&uuml;ller, was to be there to watch
with them till Lenoir either came out from or went into the house;
and that as soon as he pointed him out to the sergeant in command,
he was to be arrested, put into a cab waiting for the purpose, and
conveyed to La Roquette.</p>
<p>Behold us, then, at the time prescribed, lounging in the doorway
of a small shop adjoining the private entrance to Madame
Mar&ocirc;t's house; our hands in our pockets; our cigars in our
mouths; our whole attitude expressive of idleness and unconcern.
The wintry evening has closed in rapidly. The street is bright with
lamps, and busy with passers-by. The shop behind us is quite
dark--so dark that not the keenest observer passing by could detect
the dusky group of soldiers sitting on the counter within, or the
gleaming of the musket-barrels which rest between their knees. The
sergeant in command, a restless, black-eyed, intelligent little
Gascon, about five feet four in height, with a revolver stuck in
his belt, paces impatiently to and fro, and whistles softly between
his teeth. The men, four in number, whisper together from time to
time, or swing their feet in silence.</p>
<p>Thus the minutes go by heavily; for it is weary work waiting in
this way, uncertain how long the watch may last, and not daring to
relax the vigilance of eye and ear for a single moment. It may be
for an hour, or for many hours, or it may be for only a few
minutes-who can tell? Of Lenoir's daily haunts and habits we know
nothing. All we do know is that he is wont to be out all day,
sometimes returning only to dress and go out again; sometimes not
coming home till very late at night; sometimes absenting himself
for a day and a night, or two days and two nights together. With
this uncertain prospect before us, therefore, we wait and watch,
and watch and wait, counting the hours as they strike, and scanning
every face that gleams past in the lamplight.</p>
<p>So the first hour goes by, and the second. Ten o'clock strikes.
The traffic in the street begins perceptibly to diminish. Shops
close here and there (Madame Mar&ocirc;t's shutters have been put
up by the boy in the oilskin apron more than an hour ago), and the
<i>chiffonnier</i>, sure herald of the quieter hours of the night,
flits by with rake and lanthorn, observant of the gutters.</p>
<p>The soldiers on' the counter yawn audibly from time to time; and
the sergeant, who is naturally of an impatient disposition,
exclaims, for the twentieth time, with an inexhaustible variety,
however, in the choice of expletives:--</p>
<p>"<i>Mais; nom de deux cent mille petards</i>! will this man of
ours never come?"</p>
<p>To which inquiry, though not directly addressed to myself, I
reply, as I have already replied once or twice before, that he may
come immediately, or that he may not come for hours; and that all
we can do is to wait and be patient. In the midst of which
explanation, M&uuml;ller suddenly lays his hand on my arm, makes a
sign to the sergeant, and peers eagerly down the street.</p>
<p>There is a man coming up quickly on the opposite side of the
way. For myself, I could recognise no one at such a distance,
especially by night; but M&uuml;ller's keener eye, made keener
still by jealousy, identifies him at a glance.</p>
<p>It is Lenoir.</p>
<p>He wears a frock coat closely buttoned, and comes on with a
light, rapid step, suspecting nothing. The sergeant gives the
word--the soldiers spring to their feet--I draw back into the gloom
of the shop-and only M&uuml;ller remains, smoking his cigarette and
lounging against the door-post.</p>
<p>Then Lenoir crosses over, and M&uuml;ller, affecting to observe
him for the first time, looks up, and without lifting his hat, says
loudly:--</p>
<p>"<i>Comment</i>! have I the honor of saluting Monsieur
Lenoir?"</p>
<p>Whereupon Lenoir, thrown off his guard by the suddenness of the
address, hesitates--seems about to reply--checks himself--quickens
his pace, and passes without a word.</p>
<p>The next instant he is surrounded. The butt ends of four muskets
rattle on the pavement--the sergeant's hand is on his shoulder--the
sergeant's voice rings in his ear.</p>
<p>"Number two hundred and seven, you are my prisoner!"</p>
<br>

<h3>THE END OF BRAS BE FER.</h3>
<br>
<p>Lenoir's first impulse was to struggle in silence; then, finding
escape hopeless, he folded his arms and submitted.</p>
<p>"So, it is Monsieur M&uuml;ller who has done me this service,"
he said coldly; but with a flash in his eye like the sudden glint
in the eye of a cobra di capello. "I will take care not to be
unmindful of the obligation."</p>
<p>Then, turning impatiently upon the sergeant:--</p>
<p>"Have you no carriage at hand?" he said, sharply; "or do you
want to collect a crowd in the street?"</p>
<p>The cab, however, which had been waiting a few doors lower down,
drove up while he was speaking. The sergeant hurried him in; the
half-dozen loiterers who had already gathered about us pressed
eagerly forward; two of the soldiers and the sergeant got inside;
M&uuml;ller and I scrambled up beside the driver; word was given
"to the Pr&eacute;fecture of Police;" and we drove rapidly away
down the Rue du Faubourg St. Denis, through the arch of Louis
Quatorze, out upon the bright noisy Boulevard, and on through
thoroughfares as brilliant and crowded as at midday, towards the
quays and the river.</p>
<p>Arrived at the Quai des Ort&euml;vres, we alighted at the
Pr&eacute;fecture, and were conducted through a series of
ante-rooms and corridors into the presence of the same bald-headed
Chef de Bureau whom we had seen on each previous occasion. He
looked up as we came in, pressed the spring of a small bell that
stood upon his desk, and growled something in the ear of a clerk
who answered the summons.</p>
<p>"Sergeant," he said, pompously, "bring the prisoner under the
gas-burner."</p>
<p>Lenoir, without waiting to be brought, took a couple of steps
forward, and placed himself in the light.</p>
<p>Monsieur le Chef then took out his double eye-glass, and
proceeded to compare Lenoir's face, feature by feature, with a
photograph which he took out of his pocket-book for the
purpose.</p>
<p>"Are you prepared, Monsieur," he said, addressing M&uuml;ller
for the first time--"are you, I say, prepared to identify the
prisoner upon oath?"</p>
<p>"Within certain limitations--yes," replied M&uuml;ller.</p>
<p>"Certain limitations!" exclaimed the Chef, testily. "What do you
mean by 'certain limitations?' Here is the man whom you accuse, and
here is the photograph. Are you, I repeat, prepared to make your
deposition before Monsieur le Pr&eacute;fet that they are one and
the same person?"</p>
<p>"I am neither more nor less prepared, Monsieur," said
M&uuml;ller, "than you are; or than Monsieur le Pr&eacute;fet, when
he has the opportunity of judging. As I have already had the honor
of informing you, I saw the prisoner for the first time about two
months since. Having reason to believe that he was living in Paris
under an assumed name, and wearing a decoration to which he had no
right, I prosecuted certain inquiries about him. The result of
those inquiries led me to conclude that he was an escaped convict
from the Bagnes of Toulon. Never having seen him at Toulon, I was
unable to prove this fact without assistance. You, Monsieur, have
furnished that assistance, and the proof is now in your hand. It
only remains for Monsieur le Pr&eacute;fet and yourself to decide
upon its value."</p>
<p>"Give me the photograph, Monsieur Marmot," said a pale little
man in blue spectacles, who had come in unobserved from a door
behind us, while M&uuml;ller was speaking.</p>
<p>The bald-headed Chef jumped up with great alacrity, bowed like a
second Sir Pertinax, and handed over the photograph.</p>
<p>"The peculiar difficulty of this case, Monsieur le
Pr&eacute;fet" ... he began.</p>
<p>The Pr&eacute;fet waved his hand.</p>
<p>"Thanks, Monsieur Marmot," he said, "I know all the particulars
of this case. You need not trouble to explain them. So this is the
photograph forwarded from Toulon. Well--well! Sergeant, strip the
prisoner's shoulders."</p>
<p>A sudden quiver shot over Lenoir's face at this order, and his
cheek blenched under the tan; but he neither spoke nor resisted.
The next moment his coat and waistcoat were lying on the ground;
his shirt, torn in the rough handling, was hanging round his loins,
and he stood before us naked to the waist, lean, brown, muscular--a
torso of an athlete done in bronze.</p>
<p>We pressed round eagerly. Monsieur le Chef put up his double
eye-glass; Monsier le Pr&eacute;fet took off his blue
spectacles.</p>
<p>"So--so," he said, pointing with the end of his glasses towards
a whitish, indefinite kind of scar on Lenoir's left shoulder, "here
is a mark like a burn. Is this the brand?"</p>
<p>The sergeant nodded.</p>
<p>"V'l&agrave;, M'sieur le Pr&eacute;fet!" he said, and struck the
spot smartly with his open palm. Instantly the smitten place turned
livid, while from the midst of it, like the handwriting on the
wall, the fatal letters T. F. sprang out in characters of fire.</p>
<p>Lenoir flashed a savage glance upon us, and checked the
imprecation that rose to his lips. Monsieur le Pr&eacute;fet, with
a little nod of satisfaction, put on his glasses again, went over
to the table, took out a printed form from a certain drawer, dipped
a pen in the ink, and said:--</p>
<p>"Sergeant, you will take this order, and convey Number Two
Hundred and Seven to the Bic&ecirc;tre, there to remain till
Thursday next, when he will be drafted back to Toulon by the
convict train, which leaves two hours after midnight. Monsieur
M&uuml;ller, the Government is indebted to you for the assistance
you have rendered the executive in this matter. You are probably
aware that the prisoner is a notorious criminal, guilty of one
proved murder, and several cases of forgery, card-sharping, and the
like. The Government is also indebted to Monsieur Marmot" (here he
inclined his head to the bald-headed Chef), "who has acted with his
usual zeal and intelligence."</p>
<p>Monsieur Marmot, murmuring profuse thanks, bowed and bowed
again, and followed Monsieur le Pr&eacute;fet obsequiously to the
door. On the threshold, the great little man paused, turned, and
said very quietly: "You understand, sergeant, this prisoner does
<i>not</i> escape again;" and so vanished; leaving Monsieur Marmot
still bowing in the doorway.</p>
<p>Then the sergeant hurried on Lenoir's coat and waistcoat,
clapped a pair of handcuffs on his wrists, thrust his hat on his
head, and prepared to be gone; Monsieur, the bald-headed, looking
on, meanwhile, with the utmost complacency, as if taking to himself
all the merit of discovery and capture.</p>
<p>"Pardon, Messieurs," said the serjeant, when all was ready.
"Pardon--but here is a fellow for whom I am responsible now, and
who must be strictly looked after. I shall have to put a gendarme
on the box from here to the Bic&ecirc;tre, instead of you two
gentlemen."</p>
<p>"All right, <i>mon ami</i>" said M&uuml;ller. "I suppose we
should not have been admitted if we had gone with you?"</p>
<p>"Nay, I could pass you in, Messieurs, if you cared to see the
affair to the end, and followed in another <i>fiacre</i>."</p>
<p>So we said we would see it to the end, and following the
prisoner and his guard through all the rooms and corridors by which
we had come, picked up a second cab on the Quai des
Orf&egrave;vres, just outside the Pr&eacute;fecture of Police.</p>
<p>It was now close upon midnight. The sky was flecked with driving
clouds. The moon had just risen above the towers of Notre Dame. The
quays were silent and deserted. The river hurried along, swirling
and turbulent. The sergeant's cab led the way, and the driver,
instead of turning back towards the Pont Neuf, followed the line of
the quays along the southern bank of the Ile de la Cit&eacute;;
passing the Morgue--a mass of sinister shadow; passing the
H&ocirc;tel Dieu; traversing the Parvis Notre Dame; and making for
the long bridge, then called the Pont Louis Philippe, which
connects the two river islands with the northern half of Paris.</p>
<p>"It is a wild-looking night," said M&uuml;ller, as we drove
under the mountainous shadow of Notre Dame and came out again in
sight of the river.</p>
<p>"And it is a wild business to be out upon," I added. "I wonder
if this is the end of it?"</p>
<p>The words were scarcely past my lips when the door of the cab
ahead flew suddenly open, and a swift something, more like a shadow
than a man, darted across the moonlight, sprang upon the parapet of
the bridge, and disappeared!</p>
<p>In an instant we were all out--all rushing to and fro--all
shouting--all wild with surprise and confusion.</p>
<p>"One man to the Pont d'Arcole!" thundered the sergeant, running
along the perapet, revolver in hand. "One to the Quai Bourbon--one
to the Pont de la Cit&eacute;! Watch up stream and down! The moment
he shows his head above water, fire!"</p>
<p>"But, in Heaven's name, how did he escape?" exclaimed
M&uuml;ller.</p>
<p>"<i>Grand Dieu</i>! who can tell--unless he is the very devil?"
cried the sergeant, distractedly. "The handcuffs were on the floor,
the door was open, and he was gone in a breath! Hold! What's
that?"</p>
<p>The soldier on the Pont de la Cit&eacute; gave a shout and
fired. There was a splash--a plunge--a rush to the opposite
parapet.</p>
<p>"There he goes!"</p>
<p>"Where?"</p>
<p>"He has dived again!"</p>
<p>"Look--look yonder--between the floating bath and the bank!"</p>
<p>The sergeant stood motionless, his revolver ready cocked--the
water swirled and eddied, eddied and parted--a dark dot rose for a
second to the surface!</p>
<p>Three shots fired at the same moment (one by the sergeant, two
by the soldiers) rang sharply through the air, and were echoed with
startling suddenness again and again from the buttressed walls of
Notre Dame. Ere the last echo had died away, or the last faint
smoke-wreath had faded, two boats were pulling to the spot, and all
the quays were alive with a fast-gathering crowd. The sergeant
beckoned to the gendarme who had come upon the box.</p>
<p>"Bid the boatmen drag the river just here between the two
bridges," he said, "and bring the body up to the
Pr&eacute;fecture." Then, turning to M&uuml;ller and myself, "I am
sorry to trouble you again, Messieurs," he said, "but I must ask
you to come back once more to the Quai des Orf&egrave;vres, to
depose to the facts which have just happened."</p>
<p>"But is the man shot, or has he escaped?" asked a breathless
bystander.</p>
<p>"Both," said the sergeant, with a grim smile, replacing his
revolver in his belt. "He has escaped Toulon; but he has gone to
the bottom of the Seine with something like six ounces of lead in
his skull."</p>

<h3>THE ENIGMA OF THE THIRD STORY.</h3>
<center>Who ever loved, that loved not at first
sight?--MARLOWE.</center>
<br>
<p>In Paris, a lodging-house (or, as they prefer to style it, a
<i>h&ocirc;tel meubl&eacute;</i>) is a little town in itself; a
beehive swarming from basement to attic; a miniature model of the
great world beyond, with all its loves and hatreds, jealousies,
aspirations, and struggles. Like that world, it contains several
grades of society, but with this difference, that those who therein
occupy the loftiest position are held in the lowest estimation.
Thus, the fifth-floor lodgers turn up their noses at the
inhabitants of the attics; while the fifth-floor is in its turn
scorned by the fourth, and the fourth is despised by the third, and
the third by the second, down to the magnificent dwellers on <i>the
premier &eacute;tage</i>, who live in majestic disdain of everybody
above or beneath them, from the grisettes in the garret, to the
<i>concierge</i> who has care of the cellars.</p>
<p>The house in which I lived in the Cit&eacute; Berg&egrave;re
was, in fact, a double house, and contained no fewer than thirty
tenants, some of whom had wives, children, and servants. It
consisted of six floors, and each floor contained from eight to ten
rooms. These were let in single chambers, or in suites, as the case
might be; and on the outer doors opening round the landings were
painted the names, or affixed the visiting-cards, of the dwellers
within. My own third-floor neighbors were four in number. To my
left lived a certain Monsieur and Madame Lemercier, a retired
couple from Alsace. Opposite their door, on the other side of the
well staircase, dwelt one Monsieur Cliquot, an elderly
<i>employ&eacute;</i> in some public office; next to him, Signor
Milanesi, an Italian refugee who played in the orchestra at the
<i>Vari&eacute;t&eacute;s</i> every night, was given to practising
the violoncello by day, and wore as much hair about his face as a
Skye-terrier. Lastly, in the apartment to my right, resided a lady,
upon whose door was nailed a small visiting-card engraved with
these words:--</p>
<blockquote>MLLE. HORTENSE DUFRESNOY.<br>
<br>
<i>Teacher of Languages</i>.</blockquote>
<p>I had resided in the house for months before I ever beheld this
Mademoiselle Hortense Dufresnoy. When I did at last encounter her
upon the stairs one dusk autumnal evening, she wore a thick black
veil, and, darting past me like a bird on the wing, disappeared
down the staircase in fewer moments than I take to write it. I
scarcely observed her at the time. I had no more curiosity to learn
whether the face under that veil was pretty or plain than I cared
to know whether the veil itself was Shetland or Chantilly. At that
time Paris was yet new to me: Madame de Marignan's evil influence
was about me; and, occupied as my time and thoughts were with
unprofitable matters, I took no heed of my fellow-lodgers. Save,
indeed, when the groans of that much-tortured violoncello woke me
in the morning to an unwelcome consciousness of the vicinity of
Signor Milanesi, I should scarcely have remembered that I was not
the only inhabitant of the third story.</p>
<p>Now, however, that I spent all my evenings in my own quiet room,
I became, by imperceptible degrees, interested in the unseen
inhabitant of the adjoining apartment. Sometimes, when the house
was so still that the very turning of the page sounded unnaturally
loud, and the mere falling of a cinder startled me, I heard her in
her chamber, singing softly to herself. Every night I saw the light
from her window streaming out over the balcony and touching the
evergreens with a midnight glow. Often and often, when it was so
late that even I had given up study and gone to bed, I heard her
reading aloud, or pacing to and fro to the measure of her own
recitations. Listen as I would, I could only make out that these
recitations were poetical fragments--I could only distinguish a
certain chanted metre, the chiming of an occasional rhyme, the
rising and falling of a voice more than commonly melodious.</p>
<p>This vague interest gave place by-and-by to active curiosity. I
resolved to question Madame Bou&iuml;sse, the <i>concierge</i>; and
as she, good soul! loved gossip not wisely, but too well, I soon
knew all the little she had to tell.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle Hortense, it appeared, was the enigma of the third
story. She had resided in the house for more than two years. She
earned her living by her labor; went out teaching all the day; sat
up at night, studying and writing; had no friends; received no
visitors; was as industrious as a bee, and as proud as a princess.
Books and flowers were her only friends, and her only luxuries.
Poor as she was, she was continually filling her shelves with the
former, and supplying her balcony with the latter. She lived
frugally, drank no wine, was singularly silent and reserved, and
"like a real lady," said the fat <i>concierge</i>, "paid her rent
to the minute."</p>
<p>This, and no more, had Madame Bou&iuml;sse to tell. I had sought
her in her own little retreat at the foot of the public staircase.
It was a very wet afternoon, and under pretext of drying my boots
by the fire, I stayed to make conversation and elicit what
information I could. Now Madame Bou&iuml;sse's sanctuary was a
queer, dark, stuffy little cupboard devoted to many heterogeneous
uses, and it "served her for parlor, kitchen, and all." In one
corner stood that famous article of furniture which became "a bed
by night, a chest of drawers by day." Adjoining the bed was the
fireplace; near the fireplace stood a corner cupboard filled with
crockery and surmounted by a grand ormolu clock, singularly at
variance with the rest of the articles. A table, a warming-pan, and
a couple of chairs completed the furniture of the room, which, with
all its contents, could scarcely have measured more than eight feet
square. On a shelf inside the door stood thirty flat candlesticks;
and on a row of nails just beneath them, hung two and twenty bright
brass chamber-door keys--whereby an apt arithmetician might have
divined that exactly two-and-twenty lodgers were out in the rain,
and only eight housed comfortably within doors.</p>
<p>"And how old should you suppose this lady to be?" I asked,
leaning idly against the table whereon Madame Bou&iuml;sse was
preparing an unsavory dish of veal and garlic.</p>
<p>The <i>concierge</i> shrugged her ponderous shoulders.</p>
<p>"Ah, bah, M'sieur, I am no judge of age," said she.</p>
<p>"Well--is she pretty?"</p>
<p>"I am no judge of beauty, either," grinned Madame
Bou&iuml;sse.</p>
<p>"But, my dear soul," I expostulated, "you have eyes!"</p>
<p>"Yours are younger than mine, <i>mon enfant</i>," retorted the
fat <i>concierge</i>; "and, as I see Mam'selle Hortense coming up
to the door, I'd advise you to make use of them for yourself."</p>
<p>And there, sure enough, was a tall and slender girl, dressed all
in black, pausing to close up her umbrella at the threshold of the
outer doorway. A porter followed her, carrying a heavy parcel.
Having deposited this in the passage, he touched his cap and stated
his charge. The young lady took out her purse, turned over the
coins, shook her head, and finally came up to Madame's little
sanctuary.</p>
<p>"Will you be so obliging, Madame Bou&iuml;sse," she said, "as to
lend me a piece of ten sous? I have no small change left in my
purse."</p>
<p>How shall I describe her? If I say that she was not particularly
beautiful, I do her less than justice; for she was beautiful, with
a pale, grave, serious beauty, unlike the ordinary beauty of woman.
But even this, her beauty of feature, and color, and form, was
eclipsed and overborne by that "true beauty of the soul" which
outshines all other, as the sun puts out the stars.</p>
<p>There was in her face--or, perhaps, rather in her expression--an
indefinable something that came upon me almost like a memory. Had I
seen that face in some forgotten dream of long ago? Brown-haired
was she, and pale, with a brow "as chaste ice, as pure as snow,"
and eyes--</p>
<blockquote>"In whose orb a shadow lies,<br>
Like the dusk in evening skies!"</blockquote>
<p>Eyes lit from within, large, clear, lustrous, with a meaning in
them so profound and serious that it was almost sorrowful,--like
the eyes of Giotto's saints and Cimabue's Madonnas.</p>
<p>But I cannot describe her--</p>
<p>"For oh, her looks had something excellent That wants a
name!"</p>
<p>I can only look back upon her with "my mind's eye," trying to
see her as I saw her then for the first time, and striving to
recall my first impressions.</p>
<p>Madame Bou&iuml;sse, meanwhile, searched in all the corners of
her ample pockets, turned out her table-drawer, dived into the
recesses of her husband's empty garments, and peeped into every
ornament upon the chimney-piece; but in vain. There was no such
thing as a ten-sous piece to be found.</p>
<p>"Pray, M'sieur Basil," said she, "have you one?"</p>
<p>"One what?" I ejaculated, startled out of my reverie.</p>
<p>"Why, a ten-sous piece, to be sure. Don't you see that Mam'selle
Hortense is waiting in her wet shoes, and that I have been hunting
for the last five minutes, and can't find one anywhere?"</p>
<p>Blushing like a school-boy, and stammering some unintelligible
excuse, I pulled out a handful of francs and half-francs, and
produced the coin required.</p>
<p>"<i>Dame</i>!" said the <i>concierge</i>. "This comes of using
one's eyes too well, my young Monsieur. Hem! I'm not so blind but
that I can see as far as my neighbors."</p>
<p>Mademoiselle Hortense had fortunately gone back to settle with
the porter, so this observation passed unheard. The man being
dismissed, she came back, carrying the parcel. It was evidently
heavy, and she put it down on the nearest chair.</p>
<p>"I fear, Madame Bou&iuml;sse," she said, "that I must ask you to
help me with this. I am not strong enough to carry it
upstairs."</p>
<p>More alert this time, I took a step in advance, and offered my
services.</p>
<p>"Will Mademoiselle permit me to take it?" I said. "I am going
upstairs."</p>
<p>She hesitated.</p>
<p>"Many thanks," she said, reluctantly, "but...."</p>
<p>"But Madame Bou&iuml;sse is busy," I urged, "and the <i>pot au
feu</i> will spoil if she leaves it on the fire."</p>
<p>The fat <i>concierge</i> nodded, and patted me on the
shoulder.</p>
<p>"Let him carry the parcel, Mam'selle Hortense," she chuckled.
"Let him carry it. M'sieur is your neighbor, and neighbors should
be neighborly. Besides," she added, in an audible aside, "he is a
<i>bon gar&ccedil;on</i>--an Englishman--and a book-student like
yourself."</p>
<p>The young lady bent her head, civilly, but proudly. Compelled,
as it seemed, to accept my help, she evidently wished to show me
that I must nevertheless put forward no claim to further
intercourse--not even on the plea of neighborhood. I understood
her, and taking up the parcel, followed her in silence to her door
on the third story. Here she paused and thanked me.</p>
<p>"Pray let me carry it in for you," I said.</p>
<p>Again she hesitated; but only for an instant. Too well-bred not
to see that a refusal would now be a discourtesy, she unlocked the
door, and held it open.</p>
<p>The first room was an ante-chamber; the second a <i>salon</i>
somewhat larger than my own, with a door to the right, leading into
what I supposed would be her bedroom. At a glance, I took in all
the details of her home. There was her writing-table laden with
books and papers, her desk, and her pile of manuscripts. At one end
of the room stood a piano doing duty as a side-board, and looking
as if it were seldom opened. Some water-color drawings were pinned
against the walls, and a well-filled bookcase stood in a recess
beside the fireplace. Nothing escaped me --not even the shaded
reading-lamp, nor the plain ebony time-piece, nor the bronze Apollo
on the bracket above the piano, nor the sword over the mantelpiece,
which seemed a strange ornament in the study of a gentle lady.
Besides all this, there were books everywhere, heaped upon the
tables, ranged on shelves, piled in corners, and scattered hither
and thither in most admired disorder. It was, however, the only
disorder there.</p>
<p>I longed to linger, but dared not. Having laid the parcel down
upon the nearest chair, there was nothing left for me to do but to
take my leave. Mademoiselle Dufresnoy still kept her hand upon the
door.</p>
<p>"Accept my best thanks, sir," she said in English, with a pretty
foreign accent, that seemed to give new music to the dear familiar
tongue.</p>
<p>"You have nothing to thank me for, Mademoiselle," I replied.</p>
<p>She smiled, proudly still, but very sweetly, and closed the door
upon me.</p>
<p>I went back to my room; it had become suddenly dark and
desolate. I tried to read; but all subjects seemed alike tedious
and unprofitable. I could fix my attention to nothing; and so,
becoming restless, I went out again, and wandered about the dusky
streets till evening fairly set in, and the shops were lighted, and
the tide of passers-by began to flow faster in the direction of
boulevard and theatre.</p>
<p>The soft light of her shaded lamp streamed from her window when
I came back, nor faded thence till two hours after midnight. I
watched it all the long evening, stealing out from time to time
upon my balcony, which adjoined her own, and welcoming the cool
night air upon my brow. For I was fevered and disquieted, I knew
not why, and my heart was stirred within me, strangely and
sweetly.</p>
<p>Such was my first meeting with Hortense Dufresnoy. No incident
of it has since faded from my memory. Brief as it was, it had
already turned all the current of my life. I had fallen in love at
first sight. Yes--in love; for love it was--real, passionate,
earnest; a love destined to be the master-passion of all my future
years.</p>

<br>
CHAUCER.</center>
<br>
<p>"Love-In-Idleness" has passed into a proverb, and lovers,
somehow, are not generally supposed to be industrious. I, however,
worked none the less zealously for being in love. I applied only
the more closely to my studies, both medical and literary, and made
better progress in both than I had made before. I was not
ambitious; but I had many incentives to work. I was anxious to
satisfy my father. I earnestly desired to efface every unfavorable
impression from the mind of Dr. Ch&eacute;ron, and to gain, if
possible, his esteem. I was proud of the friendship of Madame de
Courcelles, and wished to prove the value that I placed upon her
good opinion. Above all, I had a true and passionate love of
learning--not that love which leadeth on to fame; but rather that
self-abandoning devotion which exchangeth willingly the world of
action for the world of books, and, for an uninterrupted communion
with the "souls of all that men held wise," bartereth away the
society of the living.</p>
<p>Little gregarious by nature, Paris had already ceased to delight
me in the same way that it had delighted me at first. A "retired
leisure," and the society of the woman whom I loved, grew to be the
day-dream of my solitary life. And still, ever more and more
plainly, it became evident to me that for the career of the student
I was designed by nature. Bayle, Magliabecchi of Florence, Isaac
Reed, Sir Thomas Brown, Montaigne--those were the men whose lot in
life I envied--those the literary anchorites in whose steps I would
fain have followed.</p>
<p>But this was not to be; so I worked on, rose early, studied
late, gained experience, took out my second inscription with
credit, and had the satisfaction of knowing that I was fast
acquiring the good opinion of Dr. Ch&eacute;ron. Thus Christmas
passed by, and January with its bitter winds; and February set in,
bright but frosty. And still, without encouragement or nope, I went
on loving Hortense Dufresnoy.</p>
<p>My opportunities of seeing her were few and brief. A passing bow
in the hall, or a distant "good-evening" as we passed upon the
stairs, for some time made up the sum of our intercourse.
Gradually, however, a kind of formal acquaintance sprang up between
us; an acquaintance fostered by trifles and dependent on the
idlest, or what seemed the idlest, casualties. I say "seemed," for
often that which to her appeared the work of chance was the result
of elaborate contrivance on my part. She little knew, when I met
her on the staircase, how I had been listening for the last hour to
catch the echo of her step. She little dreamed when I encountered
her at the corner of the street, how I had been concealed, till
that moment, in the <i>caf&eacute;</i> over the way, ready to dart
out as soon as she appeared in sight. I would then affect either a
polite unconcern, or an air of judicious surprise, or pretend not
to lift my eyes at all till she was nearly past; and I think I must
have been a very fair actor, for it all succeeded capitally, and I
am not aware that she ever had the least suspicion of the truth.
Let me, however, recall one incident over which I had no control,
and which did more towards promoting our intercourse than all the
rest.</p>
<p>It is a cold, bright morning in February. There is a brisk
exhilaration in the air. The windows and gilded balconies sparkle
in the sun, and it is pleasant to hear the frosty ring of one's
boots upon the pavement. It is a f&ecirc;te to-day. Nothing is
doing in the lecture-rooms, and I have the whole day before me.
Meaning, therefore, to enjoy it over the fire and a book, I wisely
begin it by a walk.</p>
<p>From the Cit&eacute; Berg&egrave;re, out along the right-hand
side of the Boulevards, down past the front of the Madeleine,
across the Place de la Concorde, and up the Champs Elys&eacute;es
as far as the Arc de Triomphe; this is the route I take in going.
Arrived at the arch, I cross over, and come back by the same roads,
but on the other side of the way. I have a motive in this. There is
a certain second-hand book-shop on the opposite side of the
Boulevard des Italiens, which draws me by a wholly irresistible
attraction. Had I started on that side, I should have gone no
further. I should have looked, lingered, purchased, and gone home
to read. But I know my weakness. I have reserved the book-shop for
my return journey, and now, rewarded and triumphant, compose myself
for a quiet study of its treasures.</p>
<p>And what a book-shop it is! Not only are its windows filled--not
only are its walls a very perspective of learning--but square
pillars of volumes are built up on either side of the door, and an
immense supplementary library is erected in the open air, down all
the length of a dead-wall adjoining the house.</p>
<p>Here then I pause, turning over the leaves of one volume,
reading the title of another, studying the personal appearance of a
third, and weighing the merits of their authors against the
contents of my purse. And when I say "personal appearance," I say
it advisedly; for book-hunters, are skilled Lavaters in their way,
and books, like men, attract or repel at first sight. Thus it
happens that I love a portly book, in a sober coat of calf, but
hate a thin, smart volume, in a gaudy binding. The one promises to
be philosophic, learnedly witty, or solidly instructive; the other
is tolerably certain to be pert and shallow, and reminds me of a
coxcombical lacquey in bullion and red plush. On the same
principle, I respect leaves soiled and dog's-eared, but mistrust
gilt edges; love an old volume better than a new; prefer a spacious
book-stall to all the unpurchased stores of Paternoster Row; and
buy every book that I possess at second-hand. Nay, that it is
second-hand is in itself a pass port to my favor. Somebody has read
it before; therefore it is readable. Somebody has derived pleasure
from it before; therefore I open it with a student's sympathy, and
am disposed to be indulgent ere I have perused a single line. There
are cases, however, in which I incline to luxury of binding. Just
as I had rather have my historians in old calf and my chroniclers
in black letter, so do I delight to see my modern poets, the
Benjamins of my affections, clothed in coats of many colors. For
them no moroccos are too rich, and no "toolings" too elaborate. I
love to see them smiling on me from the shelves of my book-cases,
as glowing and varied as the sunset through a painted oriel.</p>
<p>Standing here, then, to-day, dipping first into this work and
then into that, I light upon a very curious and interesting edition
of <i>Froissart</i>--an edition full of quaint engravings, and
printed in the obsolete spelling of two hundred years ago. The book
is both a treasure and a bargain, being marked up at five and
twenty francs. Only those who haunt book-stalls and luxuriate in
old editions can appreciate the satisfaction with which I
survey</p>
<blockquote>"That weight of wood, with leathern coat overlaid,<br>
Those ample clasps of solid metal made,<br>
The close pressed leaves unclosed for many an age,<br>
The dull red edging of the well-filled page,<br>
And the broad back, with stubborn ridges roll'd,<br>
Where yet the title stands in tarnished gold!"</blockquote>
<p>They only can sympathize in the eagerness with which I snatch up
the precious volume, the haste with which I count out the five and
twenty francs, the delight with which I see the dealer's hand close
on the sum, and know that the book is legally and indisputably
mine! Then how lovingly I embrace it under my arm, and taking
advantage of my position as a purchaser, stroll leisurely round the
inner warehouse, still courting that literary world which (in a
library at least) always turns its back upon its worshipper!</p>
<p>"Pray, Monsieur," says a gentle voice at the door, "where is
that old <i>Froissart</i> that I saw outside about a quarter of an
hour ago?"</p>
<p>"Just sold, Madame," replies the bookseller, promptly.</p>
<p>"Oh, how unfortunate!--and I only went home for the money"
exclaims the lady in a tone of real disappointment.</p>
<p>Selfishly exultant, I hug the book more closely, turn to steal a
glance at my defeated rival, and recognise--Mademoiselle
Dufresnoy.</p>
<p>She does not see me. I am standing in the inner gloom of the
shop, and she is already turning away. I follow her at a little
distance; keep her in sight all the way home; let her go into the
house some few seconds in advance; and then, scaling three stairs
at a time, overtake her at the door of her apartment.</p>
<p>Flushed and breathless, I stand beside her with <i>Froissart</i>
in my hand.</p>
<p>"Pardon, Mademoiselle," I say, hurriedly, "for having
involuntarily forestalled you just now. I had just bought the book
you wished to purchase,"</p>
<p>She looks at me with evident surprise and some coldness; but
says nothing.</p>
<p>"And I am rejoiced to have this opportunity of transferring it
to you."</p>
<p>Mademoiselle Dufresnoy makes a slight but decided gesture of
refusal.</p>
<p>"I would not deprive you of it, Monsieur," she says promptly,
"upon any consideration."</p>
<p>"But, Mademoiselle, unless you allow me to relinquish it in your
favor, I beg to assure you that I shall take the book back to the
bookseller and exchange it for some other."</p>
<p>"I cannot conceive why you should do that, Monsieur."</p>
<p>"In order, Mademoiselle, that you may still have it in your
power to become the purchaser."</p>
<p>"And yet you wished to possess the book, or you would not have
bought it."</p>
<p>"I would not have bought it, Mademoiselle, if I had known that I
should disappoint a--a lady by doing so,"</p>
<p>I was on the point of saying, "if I had known that I should
disappoint you by so doing," but hesitated, and checked myself in
time.</p>
<p>A half-mocking smile flitted across her lips.</p>
<p>"Monsieur is too self-sacrificing," she said. "Had I first
bought the book, I should have kept it--being a woman. Reverse the
case as you will, and show me any just reason why you should not do
the same--being a man?"</p>
<p>"Nay, the merest by-law of courtesy..." I began,
hesitatingly.</p>
<p>"Do not think me ungracious, Monsieur," she interrupted, "if I
hold that these so-called laws of courtesy are in truth but
concessions, for the most part, from the strength of your sex to
the weakness of ours."</p>
<p>"<i>Eh bien</i>, Mademoiselle--what then?"</p>
<p>"Then, Monsieur, may there not be some women---myself, for
instance--who do not care to be treated like children?"</p>
<p>"Pardon, Mademoiselle, but are you stating the case quite
fairly? Is it not rather that we desire not to efface the last
lingering tradition of the age of chivalry--not to reduce to prose
the last faint echoes of that poetry which tempered the sword of
the Crusader and inspired the song of the Trouv&egrave;re?"</p>
<p>"Were it not better that the new age created a new code and a
new poetry?" said Mademoiselle Dufresnoy.</p>
<p>"Perhaps; but I confess I love old forms and usages, and cling
to creeds outworn. Above all, to that creed which in the age of
powder and compliment, no less than in the age of chivalry,
enjoined absolute devotion and courtesy towards women."</p>
<p>"Against mere courtesy reasonably exercised and in due season, I
have nothing to say," replied Mademoiselle Dufresnoy; "but the
half-barbarous homage of the Middle Ages is as little to my taste
as the scarcely less barbarous refinement of the Addison and
Georgian periods. Both are alike unsound, because both have a basis
of insincerity. Just as there is a mock refinement more vulgar than
simple vulgarity, so are there courtesies which humiliate and
compliments that offend."</p>
<p>"Mademoiselle is pleased to talk in paradoxes," said I.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle unlocked her door, and turning towards me with the
same half-mocking smile and the same air of raillery, said:--</p>
<p>"Monsieur, it is written in your English histories that when
John le Bon was taken captive after the battle of Cressy, the Black
Prince rode bareheaded before him through the streets of London,
and served him at table as the humblest of his attendants. But for
all that, was John any the less a prisoner, or the Black Prince any
the less a conqueror?"</p>
<p>"You mean, perhaps, that you reject all courtesy based on mere
ceremonial. Let me then put the case of this <i>Froissart</i> more
plainly--as I would have done from the first, had I dared to speak
the simple truth."</p>
<p>"And that is...?"</p>
<p>"That it will give me more pleasure to resign the book to you,
Mademoiselle, than to possess it myself."</p>
<p>Mademoiselle Dufresnoy colors up, looks both haughty and amused,
and ends by laughing.</p>
<p>"In truth, Monsieur," she says merrily, "if your politeness
threatened at first to be too universal, it ends by becoming
unnecessarily particular."</p>
<p>"Say rather, Mademoiselle, that you will not have the book on
any terms!" I exclaim impatiently.</p>
<p>"Because you have not yet offered it to me upon any just or
reasonable grounds."</p>
<p>"Well, then, bluntly and frankly, as student to student, I beg
you to spare me the trouble of carrying this book back to the
Boulevard. Yours, Mademoiselle, was the first intention. You saw
the book before I saw it. You would have bought it on the spot, but
had to go home for the money. In common equity, it is yours. In
common civility, as student to student, I offer it to you. Say, is
it yes or no?"</p>
<p>"Since you put it so simply and so generously, and since I
believe you really wish me to accept your offer," replies
Mademoiselle Dufresnoy, taking out her purse, "I suppose I must
say--yes."</p>
<p>And with this, she puts out her hand for the hook, and offers me
in return the sum of five and twenty francs.</p>
<p>Pained at having to accept the money, pained at being offered
it, seeing no way of refusing it, and feel altogether more distress
than is reasonable in a man brought up to the taking of fees; I
affect not to see the coin, and, bowing, move away in the direction
of my own door.</p>
<p>"Pardon, Monsieur," she says, "but you forget that I am in your
debt."</p>
<p>"And--and do you really insist..."</p>
<p>She looks at me, half surprised and half offended.</p>
<p>"If you do not take the money, Monsieur, how can I take the
book?"</p>
<p>Bowing, I receive the unwelcome francs in my unwilling palm.</p>
<p>Still she lingers.</p>
<p>"I--I have not thanked you as I ought for your generosity," she
says, hesitatingly.</p>
<p>"Generosity!" I repeat, glancing with some bitterness at the
five and twenty francs.</p>
<p>"True kindness, Monsieur, is neither bought nor sold," says the
lady, with the loveliest smile in the world, and closes her
door.</p>

<h3>THE OLD, OLD STORY.</h3>
<center>What thing is Love, which nought can countervail?<br>
Nought save itself--even such a thing is Love.<br>
<br>
SIR W. RALEIGH.</center>
<br>
<p>My acquaintance with Hortense Dufresnoy progressed slowly as,
ever, and not even the Froissart incident went far towards
promoting it. Absorbed in her studies, living for the intellect
only, too self-contained to know the need for sympathy, she
continued to be, at all events for me, the most inaccessible of
God's creatures. And yet, despite her indifference, I loved her.
Her pale, proud face haunted me; her voice haunted me. I thought of
her sometimes till it seemed impossible she should not in some way
be conscious of how my very soul was centred in her. But she knew
nothing--guessed nothing--cared nothing; and the knowledge that I
held no place in her life wrought in me at times till it became
almost too bitter for endurance.</p>
<p>And this was love--real, passionate, earnest; the first and last
love of my heart. Did I believe that I ever loved till now? Ah! no;
for now only I felt the god in his strength, and beheld him in his
beauty. Was I not blind till I had looked into her eyes and drunk
of their light? Was I not deaf till I had heard the music of her
voice? Had I ever truly lived, or breathed, or known delight till
now?</p>
<p>I never stayed to ask myself how this would end, or whither it
would lead me. The mere act of loving was too sweet for
questioning. What cared I for the uncertainties of the future,
having hope to live upon in the present? Was it not enough "to feed
for aye my lamp and flames of love," and worship her till that
worship became a religion and a rite?</p>
<p>And now, longing to achieve something which should extort at
least her admiration, if not her love, I wished I were a soldier,
that I might win glory for her--or a poet, that I might write
verses in her praise which should be deathless--or a painter, that
I might spend years of my life in copying the dear perfection of
her face. Ah! and I would so copy it that all the world should be
in love with it. Not a wave of her brown hair that I would not
patiently follow through all its windings. Not the tender tracery
of a blue vein upon her temples that I would not lovingly render
through its transparent veil of skin. Not a depth of her dark eyes
that I would not study, "deep drinking of the infinite." Alas!
those eyes, so grave, so luminous, so steadfast:--</p>
<blockquote>"Eyes not down-dropt, not over-bright, but fed<br>
&nbsp;With the clear-pointed flame of chastity,"</blockquote>
<p>--eyes wherein dwelt "thought folded over thought," what painter
need ever hope to copy them?</p>
<p>And still she never dreamed how dear she had grown to me. She
never knew how the very air seemed purer to me because she breathed
it. She never guessed how I watched the light from her window night
after night--how I listened to every murmur in her chamber--how I
watched and waited for the merest glimpse of her as she passed
by--how her lightest glance hurried the pulses through my
heart--how her coldest word was garnered up in the treasure-house
of my memory! What cared she, though to her I had dedicated all the
"book and volume of my brain;" hallowed its every page with
blazonings of her name; and illuminated it, for love of her, with
fair images, and holy thoughts, and forms of saints and angels</p>
<blockquote>"Innumerable, of stains and splendid dyes<br>
As are the tiger-moth's deep damask'd wings?"</blockquote>
<p>Ah me! her hand was never yet outstretched to undo its golden
clasps--her eye had never yet deigned to rest upon its records. To
her I was nothing, or less than nothing--a fellow-student, a
fellow-lodger, a stranger.</p>
<p>And yet I loved her "with a love that was more than love"--with
a love dearer than life and stronger than death--a love that, day
after day, struck its roots deeper and farther into my very soul,
never thence to be torn up here or hereafter.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIII."></a>CHAPTER XLIII.</h2>
<h3>ON A WINTER'S EVENING.</h3>
<br>
<p>After a more than usually severe winter, the early spring came,
crowned with rime instead of primroses. Paris was intensely cold.
In March the Seine was still frozen, and snow lay thickly on the
house-tops. Quiet at all times, the little nook in which I lived
became monastically still, and at night, when the great gates were
closed, and the footsteps of the passers-by fell noiselessly upon
the trodden snow, you might have heard a whisper from one side of
the street to the other. There was to me something indescribably
delightful about this silent solitude in the heart of a great
city.</p>
<p>Sitting beside the fire one evening, enjoying the profound calm
of the place, attending from time to time to my little coffee-pot
on the hob, and slowly turning the pages of a favorite author, I
luxuriate in a state of mind half idle, half studious. Leaving off
presently to listen to some sound which I hear, or fancy I hear, in
the adjoining room, I wonder for the twentieth time whether
Hortense has yet returned from her long day's teaching; and so
rise--open my window--and look out. Yes; the light from her
reading-lamp streams out at last across the snow-laden balcony.
Heigho! it is something even to know that she is there so near
me--divided only by a thin partition!</p>
<p>Trying to comfort myself with this thought, I close the window
again and return to my book, more restless and absent than before.
Sitting thus, with the unturned leaf lingering between my thumb and
forefinger, I hear a rapid footfall on the stairs, and a musical
whistle which, growing louder as it draws nearer, breaks off at my
door, and is followed by a prolonged assault and battery of the
outer panels.</p>
<p>"Welcome, noisiest of visitors!" I exclaim, knowing it to be
M&uuml;ller before I even open the door. "You are quite a stranger.
You have not been near me for a fortnight."</p>
<p>"It will not be your fault, Signor Book-worm, if I don't become
a stranger <i>au pied de la lettre</i>" replies he, cheerily. "Why,
man, it is close upon three weeks since you have crossed the
threshold of my door. The Quartier Latin is aggrieved by your
neglect, and the fine arts t'other side of the water languish and
are forlorn."</p>
<p>So saying, he shakes the snow from his coat like a St. Bernard
mastiff, perches his cap on the head of the plaster Niobe that
adorns my chimney-piece, and lays aside the folio which he had been
carrying under his arm. I, in the meanwhile, have wheeled an
easy-chair to the fire, brought out a bottle of Chambertin, and
piled on more wood in honor of my guest.</p>
<p>"You can't think," said I, shaking hands with him for the second
time, "how glad I am that you have come round to-night."</p>
<p>"I quite believe it," replied he. "You must be bored to death,
if these old busts are all the society you keep. <i>Sacre nom d'une
pipe</i>! how can a fellow keep up his conviviality by the
perpetual contemplation of Niobe and Jupiter Tonans? What do you
mean by living such a life as this? Have you turned Trappist? Shall
I head a subscription to present you with a skull and an
hour-glass?"</p>
<p>"I'll have the skull made into a drinking-cup, if you do. Take
some wine."</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller filled his glass, tasted with the air of a
connoisseur, and nodded approvingly.</p>
<p>"Chambertin, by the god Bacchus!" said he. "Napoleon's favorite
wine, and mine--evidence of the sympathy that exists between the
truly great."</p>
<p>And, draining the glass, he burst into a song in praise of
French wines, beginning--</p>
<blockquote>"Le Chambertin rend joyeux,<br>
Le Nuits rend infatigable,<br>
Le Volnay rend amoureux,<br>
Le Champagne rend amiable.<br>
Grisons-nous, mes chers amis,<br>
L'ivresse<br>
Vaut la richesse;<br>
Pour moi, d&egrave;s que le suis gris,<br>
Je poss&egrave;de tout Paris!"</blockquote>
<p>"Oh hush!" said I, uneasily; "not so loud, pray!"</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"The--the neighbors, you know. We cannot do as we would in the
Quartier Latin."</p>
<p>"Nonsense, my dear fellow. You don't swear yourself to silence
when you take apartments in a <i>h&ocirc;tel meubl&eacute;</i>! You
might as well live in a penitentiary!--</p>
<blockquote>'De bouchons faisons un tas,<br>
Et s'il faut avoir la goutte,<br>
Au moins que ce ne soit pas<br>
Pour n'avoir bu qu'une goutte!'"</blockquote>
<p>"Nay, I implore you!" I interposed again. "The landlord ..."</p>
<p>"Hang the landlord!</p>
<blockquote>'Grisons-nous--'"</blockquote>
<p>"Well, but--but there is a lady in the next room ..."</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks.</p>
<p>"<i>Allons done</i>!" said he, "why not have told the truth at
first? Oh, you sly rogue! You <i>gaillard</i>! This is your
seclusion, is it? This is your love of learning--this the secret of
your researches into science and art! What art, pray? Ovid's 'Art
of Love,' I'll be sworn!"</p>
<p>"Laugh on, pray," I said, feeling my face and my temper growing
hot; "but that lady, who is a stranger to me"....</p>
<p>"Oh--oh--oh!" cried M&uuml;ller.</p>
<p>"Who is a stranger to me," I repeated, "and who passes her
evenings in study, must not be annoyed by noises in my room.
Surely, my dear fellow, you know me well enough to understand
whether I am in jest or in earnest."</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller laid his hand upon my sleeve.</p>
<p>"Enough--enough," he said, smiling good-naturedly. "You are
right, and I will be as dumb as Plato. What is the lady's
name."</p>
<p>"Dufresnoy," I answered, somewhat reluctantly. "Mademoiselle
Dufresnoy."</p>
<p>"Ay, but her Christian name!"</p>
<p>"Her Christian name," I faltered, more reluctant still.
"I--I--"</p>
<p>"Don't say you don't know," said M&uuml;ller, maliciously. "It
isn't worth while. After all, what does it matter? Here's to her
health, all the same--<i>&agrave; votre sant&eacute;</i>,
Mademoiselle Dufresnoy! What! not drink her health, though I have
filled your glass on purpose?"</p>
<p>There was no help for it, so I took the glass and drank the
toast with the best grace I could.</p>
<p>"And now, tell me," continued my companion, drawing nearer to
the fire and settling himself with a confidential air that was
peculiarly provoking, "what is she like? Young or old? Dark or
fair? Plain or pretty?"</p>
<p>"Old," said I, desperately. "Old and ugly. Fifty at the least.
Squints horribly."</p>
<p>Then, thinking that I had been a little too emphatic, I
added:--</p>
<p>"But a very ladylike person, and exceedingly well-informed,"</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller looked at me gravely, and filled his glass
again.</p>
<p>"I think I know the lady," said he.</p>
<p>"Indeed?"</p>
<p>"Yes--by your description. You forgot to add, however, that she
is gray."</p>
<p>"To be sure--as a badger."</p>
<p>"To say nothing of a club foot, an impediment in her speech, a
voice like a raven's, and a hump like a dromedary's! Ah! my dear
friend, what an amazingly comic fellow you are!"</p>
<p>And the student burst again into a peal of laughter so hearty
and infectious that I could not have helped joining in it to save
my life.</p>
<p>"And now," said he, when we had laughed ourselves out of breath,
"now to the object of my visit. Do you remember asking me, months
ago, to make you a copy of an old portrait that you had taken a
fancy to in some tumble-down ch&acirc;teau near
Montlh&eacute;ry!"</p>
<p>"To be sure; and I have intended, over and over again, to remind
you of it. Did you ever take the trouble to go over there and look
at it?"</p>
<p>"Look at it, indeed! I should rather think so--and here is the
proof. What does your connoisseurship say to it?"</p>
<p>Say to it! Good heavens! what could I say, what could I do, but
flush up all suddenly with pleasure, and stare at it without power
at first to utter a single word?</p>
<p>For it was like <i>her</i>--so like that it might have been her
very portrait. The features were cast in the same mould--the brow,
perhaps, was a little less lofty--the smile a little less cold; but
the eyes, the beautiful, lustrous, soul-lighted eyes were the
same--the very same!</p>
<p>If she were to wear an old-fashioned dress, and deck her fair
neck and arms with pearls, and put powder on her hair, and stand
just so, with her hand upon one of the old stone urns in the garden
of that deserted ch&acirc;teau, she would seem to be standing for
the portrait.</p>
<p>Well might I feel, when I first saw her, that the beauty of her
face was not wholly unfamiliar to me! Well might I fancy I had seen
her in some dream of long ago!</p>
<p>So this was the secret of it--and this picture was mine. Mine to
hang before my desk when I was at work--mine to place at my bed's
foot, where I might see it on first waking--mine to worship and
adore, to weave fancies and build hopes upon, and "burn out the day
in idle phantasies" of passionate devotion!</p>
<p>"Well," said M&uuml;ller impatiently, "what do you think of
it?"</p>
<p>I looked up, like one dreaming.</p>
<p>"Think of it!" I repeated.</p>
<p>"Yes--do you think it like?"</p>
<p>"So like that it might be her por ... I mean that it might be
the original."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's satisfactory. I was afraid you were
disappointed."</p>
<p>"I was only silent from surprise and pleasure."</p>
<p>"Well, however faithful the copy maybe, you know, in these
things one always misses the tone of age."</p>
<p>"I would not have it look a day older!" I exclaimed, never
lifting my eyes from the canvas.</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller came and looked down at it over my shoulder.</p>
<p>"It is an interesting head," said he. "I have a great mind to
introduce it into my next year's competition picture."</p>
<p>I started as if he had struck me. The thought was sacrilege!</p>
<p>"For Heaven's sake do no such thing!" I ejaculated.</p>
<p>"Why not?" said he, opening his eyes in astonishment.</p>
<p>"I cannot tell you why--at least not yet; but to--to confer a
very particular obligation upon me, will you waive this point?"
M&uuml;ller rubbed his head all over with both hands, and sat down
in the utmost perplexity.</p>
<p>"Upon my soul and conscience," said he, "you are the most
incomprehensible fellow I ever knew in my life!"</p>
<p>"I am. I grant it. What then? Let us see, I am to give you a
hundred and fifty francs for this copy ..."</p>
<p>"I won't take it," said M&uuml;ller. "I mean you to accept it as
a pledge of friendship and good-will."</p>
<p>"Nay, I insist on paying for it. I shall be proud to pay for it;
but a hundred and fifty are not enough. Let me give you three
hundred, and promise me that you will not put the head into your
picture!"</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller laughed, and shook his own head resolutely. "I will
give you both the portrait and the promise," said he; "but I won't
take your money, if I know it."</p>
<p>"But ..."</p>
<p>"But I won't--and so, if you don't like me well enough to accept
such a trifle from me, I'll e'en carry the thing home again!"</p>
<p>And, snatching up his cap and cloak, he made a feint of putting
the portrait back into the folio.</p>
<p>"Not for the world!" I exclaimed, taking possession of it
without further remonstrance. "I would sooner part from all I
possess. How can I ever thank you enough?"</p>
<p>"By never thanking me at all! What little time the thing has
cost me is overpaid, not only by the sight of your pleasure, but by
my own satisfaction in copying it. To copy a good work is to have a
lesson from the painter, though he were dead a hundred years
before; and the man who painted that portrait, be he who he might,
has taught me a trick or two that I never knew before.
<i>Sapristi</i>! see if I don't dazzle you some day with an effect
of white satin and pearls against a fair skin!"</p>
<p>"An ingenious argument; but it leaves me unconvinced, all the
same. How! you are not going to run away already? Here's another
bottle of Chambertin waiting to be opened; and it is yet quite
early."</p>
<p>"Impossible! I have promised to meet a couple of men up at the
Prado, and have, besides, invited them afterwards to supper."</p>
<p>"What is the Prado?"</p>
<p>"The Prado! Why, is it possible that I have never yet introduced
you to the Prado? It's one of the joiliest places in all the
Quartier Latin--it's close to the Palais de Justice. You can dance
there, or practise pistol-shooting, or play billiards, or sup--or
anything you please. Everybody smokes--ladies not excepted."</p>
<p>"How very delightful!"</p>
<p>"Oh, magnificent! Won't you come with me? I know a dozen pretty
girls who will be delighted to be introduced to you."</p>
<p>"Not to-night, thank you," said I, laughing.</p>
<p>"Well, another time?"</p>
<p>"Yes, to be sure--another time."</p>
<p>"Well, good-night."</p>
<p>"Good-night, and thank you again, a thousand times over."</p>
<p>But he would not stay to hear me thank him, and was half way
down the first flight before my sentence was finished. Just as I
was going back into my room, and about to close the door, he called
after me from the landing.</p>
<p>"<i>Hol&agrave;, amigo</i>! When my picture is done, I mean to
give a bachelor's supper-party--chiefly students and
<i>chicards</i>. Will you come?"</p>
<p>"Gladly."</p>
<p>"Adieu, then. I will let you know in time."</p>
<p>And with this, he broke out into a fragment of Beranger, gave a
cheerful good-night to Madame Bou&iuml;sse in the hall, and was
gone.</p>
<p>And now to enjoy my picture. Now to lock the door, and trim the
lamp, and place it up against a pile of books, and sit down before
it in silent rapture, like a devotee before the portrait of his
patron saint. Now I can gaze, unreproved, into those eyes, and
fancy they are hers. Now press my lips, unforbidden, upon that
exquisite mouth, and believe it warm. Ah, will her eyes ever so
give back the look of love in mine? Will her lips ever suffer mine
to come so near? Would she, if she knew the treasure I possessed,
be displeased that I so worshipped it?</p>
<p>Hanging over it thus, and suffering my thoughts to stray on at
their own will and pleasure, I am startled by the fall of some
heavy object in the adjoining chamber. The fall is followed by a
stifled cry, and then all is again silent.</p>
<p>To unlock my door and rush to hers--to try vainly to open it--to
cry "Hortense! Hortense! what has happened? For Heaven's sake, what
has happened?" is the work of but an instant.</p>
<p>The antechamber lay between, and I remembered that she could not
hear me. I ran back, knocked against the wall, and repeated:--</p>
<p>"What has happened? Tell me what has happened?"</p>
<p>Again I listened, and in that interval of suspense heard her
garments rustle along the ground, then a deep sigh, and then the
words:--</p>
<p>"Nothing serious. I have hurt my hand."</p>
<p>"Can you open the door?"</p>
<p>There was another long silence.</p>
<p>"I cannot," she said at length, but more faintly.</p>
<p>"In God's name, try!"</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>"Shall I get over the balcony?"</p>
<p>I waited another instant, heard nothing, and then, without,
further hesitation, opened my own window and climbed the iron rail
that separated her balcony from mine, leaving my footsteps trampled
in the snow.</p>
<p>I found her sitting on the floor, with her body bent forward and
her head resting against the corner of a fallen bookcase. The
scattered volumes lay all about. A half-filled portmanteau stood
close by on a chair. A travelling-cloak and a passport-case lay on
the table.</p>
<p>Seeing, yet scarcely noting all this, I flung myself on my knees
beside her, and found that one hand and arm lay imprisoned under
the bookcase. She was not insensible, but pain had deprived her of
the power of speech. I raised her head tenderly, and supported it
against a chair; then lifted the heavy bookcase, and, one by one,
removed the volumes that had fallen upon her.</p>
<p>Alas! the white little hand all crushed and bleeding--the
powerless arm--the brave mouth striving to be firm!</p>
<p>I took the poor maimed arm, made a temporary sling for it with
my cravat, and, taking her up in my arms as if she had been an
infant, carried her to the sofa. Then I closed the window; ran back
to my own room for hot water; tore up some old handkerchiefs for
bandages; and so dressed and bound her wounds--blessing (for the
first time in my life) the destiny that had made me a surgeon.</p>
<p>"Are you in much pain?" I asked, when all was done.</p>
<p>"Not now--but I feel very faint,"</p>
<p>I remembered my coffee in the next room, and brought it to her.
I lifted her head, and supported her with my arm while she drank
it.</p>
<p>"You are much better now," I said, when she had again lain down.
"Tell me how it happened."</p>
<p>She smiled languidly.</p>
<p>"It was not my fault," she said, "but Froissart's. Do you
remember that Froissart?"</p>
<p>Remember it! I should think so.</p>
<p>"Froissart!" I exclaimed. "Why, what had he to do with it?"</p>
<p>"Only this. I usually kept him on the top of the bookcase that
fell down this evening. Just now, while preparing for a journey
upon which I must start to-morrow morning, I thought to remove the
book to a safer place; and so, instead of standing on a chair, I
tried to reach up, and, reaching up, disturbed the balance of the
bookcase, and brought it down."</p>
<p>"Could you not have got out of the way when you saw it
falling?"</p>
<p>"Yes--but I tried to prevent it, and so was knocked down and
imprisoned as you found me."</p>
<p>"Merciful Heaven! it might have killed you."</p>
<p>"That was what flashed across my mind when I saw it coming," she
replied, with a faint smile.</p>
<p>"You spoke of a journey," I said presently, turning my face away
lest she should read its story too plainly; "but now, of course,
you must not move for a few days."</p>
<p>"I must travel to-morrow," she said, with quiet decision.</p>
<p>"Impossible!"</p>
<p>"I have no alternative."</p>
<p>"But think of the danger--the imprudence--the suffering."</p>
<p>"Danger there cannot be," she replied, with a touch of
impatience in her voice. "Imprudent it may possibly be; but of that
I have no time to think. And as for the suffering, that concerns
myself alone. There are mental pains harder to bear than the pains
of the body, and the consciousness of a duty unfulfilled is one of
the keenest of them. You urge in vain; I must go. And now, since it
is time you bade me good-night, let me thank you for your ready
help and say good-bye."</p>
<p>"But may I do no more for you?"</p>
<p>"Nothing--unless you will have the goodness to bid Madame
Bou&iuml;sse to come up-stairs, and finish packing my portmanteau
for me."</p>
<p>"At what hour do you start?"</p>
<p>"At eight."</p>
<p>"May I not go with you to the station, and see that you get a
comfortable seat?"</p>
<p>"Many thanks," she replied, coldly; "but I do not go by rail,
and my seat in the diligence is already taken."</p>
<p>"You will want some one to see to your luggage--to carry your
cloaks."</p>
<p>"Madame Bou&iuml;sse has promised to go with me to the
Messageries."</p>
<p>Silenced, and perhaps a little hurt, I rose to take my
leave.</p>
<p>"I wish you a safe journey, mademoiselle," I said, "and a safe
return,"</p>
<p>"And think me, at the same time, an ungrateful patient."</p>
<p>"I did not say that."</p>
<p>"No--but you thought so. After all, it is possible that I seem
so. I am undemonstrative--unused to the amenities of life--in
short, I am only half-civilized. Pray, forgive me."</p>
<p>"Mademoiselle," I said, "your apology pains me. I have nothing
to forgive. I will send Madame Bou&iuml;sse to you
immediately."</p>
<p>And with this I had almost left the room, but paused upon the
threshold.</p>
<p>"Shall you be long away?" I asked, with assumed
indifference.</p>
<p>"Shall I be long away?" she repeated, dreamily. "How can I
tell?" Then, correcting herself, "Oh, not long," she added. "Not
long. Perhaps a fortnight--perhaps a week."</p>
<p>"Once more, then, good-night."</p>
<p>"Good-night," she answered, absently; and I withdrew.</p>
<p>I then went down, sent Madame Bou&iuml;sse to wait upon her, and
sat up anxiously listening more than half the night. Next morning,
at seven, I heard Madame Bou&iuml;sse go in again. I dared not even
go to her door to inquire how she had slept, lest I should seem too
persistent; but when they left the room and went downstairs
together, I flew to my window.</p>
<p>I saw her cross the street in the gray morning. She walked
feebly, and wore a large cloak, that hid the disabled arm and
covered her to the feet. Madame Bou&iuml;sse trotted beside her
with a bundle of cloaks and umbrellas; a porter followed with her
little portmanteau on his shoulder.</p>
<p>And so they passed under the archway across the trampled snow,
and vanished out of sight.</p>

<h3>A PRESCRIPTION.</h3>
<br>
<p>A week went by--a fortnight went by--and still Hortense
prolonged her mysterious absence. Where could she be gone? Was she
ill? Had any accident befallen her on the road? What if the wounded
hand had failed to heal? What if inflammation had set in, and she
were lying, even now, sick and helpless, among strangers? These
terrors came back upon me at every moment, and drove me almost to
despair. In vain I interrogated Madame Bou&iuml;sse. The
good-natured <i>concierge</i> knew no more than myself, and the
little she had to tell only increased my uneasiness.</p>
<p>Hortense, it appeared, had taken two such journeys before, and
had, on both occasions, started apparently at a moment's notice,
and with every indication of anxiety and haste. From the first she
returned after an interval of more than three weeks; from the
second after about four or five days. Each absence had been
followed by a long season of despondency and lassitude, during
which, said the <i>concierge</i>, Mademoiselle scarcely spoke, or
ate, or slept, but, silent and pale as a ghost, sat up later than
ever with her books and papers. As for this last journey, all she
knew about it was that Mam'selle had had her passport regulated for
foreign parts the afternoon of the day before she started.</p>
<p>"But can you not remember in what direction the diligence was
going?" I asked, again and again.</p>
<p>"No, M'sieur--not in the least,"</p>
<p>"Nor the name of the town to which her place was taken?"</p>
<p>"I don't know that I ever heard it, M'sieur."</p>
<p>"But at least you must have seen the address on the
portmanteau?"</p>
<p>"Not I, M'sieur--I never thought of looking at it."</p>
<p>"Did she say nothing to account for the suddenness of her
departure?"</p>
<p>"Nothing at all."</p>
<p>"Nor about her return either. Madame Bou&iuml;sse? Just think a
moment--surely she said something about when you might expect her
back again?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, M'sieur, except, by the way--"</p>
<p>"Except what?"</p>
<p>"<i>Dame</i>! only this--as she was just going to step into the
diligence, she turned back and shook hands with me--Mam'selle
Hortense, proud as she is, is never above shaking hands with me, I
can tell you, M'sieur."</p>
<p>"No, no--I can well believe it. Pray, go on!"</p>
<p>"Well, M'sieur," she shakes hands with me, and she says, "Thank
you, good Madame Bou&iuml;sse, for all your kindness to me.... Hear
that, M'sieur, 'good Madame Bou&iuml;sse,'--the dear child!"</p>
<p>"And then--?"</p>
<p>"Bah! how impatient you are! Well, then, she says (after
thanking me, you observe)--'I have paid you my rent, Madame
Bou&iuml;sse, up to the end of the present month, and if, when the
time has expired, I have neither written nor returned, consider me
still as your tenant. If, however, I do not come back at all, I
will let you know further respecting the care of my books and other
property."</p>
<p>If she did not come back at all! Oh, Heaven! I had never
contemplated such a possibility. I left Madame Bou&iuml;sse without
another word, and going up to my own rooms, flung myself upon my
bed, as if I were stupefied.</p>
<p>All that night, all the next day, those words haunted me. They
seemed to have burned themselves into my brain in letters of fire.
Dreaming, I woke up with them upon my lips; reading, they started
out upon me from the page. "If I never come back at all!"</p>
<p>At last, when the fifth day came round--the fifth day of the
third week of her absence--I became so languid and desponding that
I lost all power of application.</p>
<p>Even Dr. Ch&eacute;ron noticed it, and calling me in the
afternoon to his private room, said:--</p>
<p>"Basil Arbuthnot, you look ill. Are you working too hard?"</p>
<p>"I don't think so, sir."</p>
<p>"Humph! Are you out much at night?"</p>
<p>"Out, sir?"</p>
<p>"Yes--don't echo my words--do you go into society: frequent
balls, theatres, and so forth?"</p>
<p>"I have not done so, sir, for several months past."</p>
<p>"What is it, then? Do you read late?"</p>
<p>"Really, sir, I hardly know--up to about one or two o'clock; on
the average, I believe."</p>
<p>"Let me feel your pulse."</p>
<p>I put out my wrist, and he held it for some seconds, looking
keenly at me all the time.</p>
<p>"Got anything on your mind?" he asked, after he had dropped it
again. "Want money, eh?"</p>
<p>"No, sir, thank you."</p>
<p>"Home-sick?"</p>
<p>"Not in the least."</p>
<p>"Hah! want amusement. Can't work perpetually--not reasonable to
suppose it. There, <i>mon gar&ccedil;on</i>," (taking a folded
paper from his pocket-book) "there's a prescription for you. Make
the most of it."</p>
<p>It was a stall-ticket for the opera. Too restless and unhappy to
reject any chance of relief, however temporary, I accepted it, and
went.</p>
<p>I had not been to a theatre since that night with Josephine, nor
to the Italian Opera since I used to go with Madame de Marignan. As
I went in listlessly and took my place, the lights, the noise, the
multitude of faces, confused and dazzled me. Presently the curtain
rose, and the piece began. The opera was <i>I Capuletti</i>. I do
not remember who the singers were, I am not sure that I ever knew.
To me they were Romeo and Juliet, and I was a dweller in Verona.
The story, the music, the scenery, took a vivid hold upon my
imagination. From the moment the curtain rose, I saw only the
stage, and, except that I in some sort established a dim comparison
between Romeo's sorrows and my own disquietude of mind, I seemed to
lose all recollection of time and place, and almost of my own
identity.</p>
<p>It seemed quite natural that that ill-fated pair of lovers
should go through life, love, wed, and die singing. And why not?
Are they not airy nothings, "born of romance, cradled in poetry,
thinking other thoughts, and doing other deeds than ours?" As they
live in poetry, so may they not with perfect fitness speak in
song?</p>
<p>I went home in a dream, with the melodies ringing in my ears and
the story lying heavy at my heart. I passed upstairs in the dark,
went over to the window, and saw, oh joy! the light--the dear,
familiar, welcome, blessed light, streaming forth, as of old, from
Hortense's chamber window!</p>
<p>To thank Heaven that she was safe was my first impulse--to step
out on the balcony, and watch the light as though it were a part of
herself, was the second. I had not been there many moments when it
was obscured by a passing shadow. The window opened and she came
out.</p>
<p>"Good-evening," she said, in her calm, clear voice. "I heard you
out here, and thought you might like to know that, thanks to your
treatment in the first instance, and such care as I have been able
since to give it, my hand is once more in working order."</p>
<p>"You are kind to come out and tell me so," I said. "I had no
hope of seeing you to-night. How long is it since you arrived?"</p>
<p>"About two hours," she replied, carelessly.</p>
<p>"And you have been nearly three weeks away!"</p>
<p>"Have I?" said she, leaning her cheek upon her hand, and looking
up dreamily into the night. "I did not count the days."</p>
<p>"That proves you passed them happily," I said; not without some
secret bitterness.</p>
<p>"Happily!" she echoed. "What is happiness?"</p>
<p>"A word that we all translate differently," I replied.</p>
<p>"And your own reading of it?" she said, interrogatively.</p>
<p>I hesitated.</p>
<p>"Do you inquire what is my need, individually?" I asked, "or do
you want my general definition?"</p>
<p>"The latter."</p>
<p>"I think, then, that the first requirement of happiness is work;
the second, success."</p>
<p>She sighed.</p>
<p>"I accept your definition," she said, "and hope that you may
realize it to the full in your own experience. For myself, I have
toiled and failed--sought, and found not. Judge, then, how I came
to leave the days uncounted."</p>
<p>The sadness of her attitude, the melancholy import of her words,
the abstraction of her manner, filled me with a vague
uneasiness.</p>
<p>"Failure is often the forerunner of success," I replied, for
want, perhaps, of something better to say.</p>
<p>She shook her head drearily, and stood looking up at the sky,
where, every now and then, the moon shone out fitfully between the
flying clouds.</p>
<p>"It is not the first time," she murmured, "nor will it be the
last--and yet they say that God is merciful."</p>
<p>She had forgotten my presence. These words were not spoken to
me, but in answer to her own thoughts. I said nothing, but watched
her upturned face. It was pale as the wan moon overhead; thinner
than before she went away; and sadder--oh, how much sadder!</p>
<p>She roused herself presently, and turning to me, said:--"I beg
your pardon. I am very absent; but I am greatly fatigued. I have
been travelling incessantly for two days and nights."</p>
<p>"Then I will wish you good-night at once," I said.</p>
<p>"Good-night," she replied; and went back into her room.</p>
<p>The next morning Dr. Ch&eacute;ron smiled one of his cold
smiles, and said:--</p>
<p>"You look better to-day, my young friend. I knew how it was with
you--no worse malady, after all, than <i>ennui</i>. I shall take
care to repeat the medicine from time to time."</p>

<h3>UNDER THE STARS.</h3>
<br>
<p>Hoping, yet scarcely expecting to see her, I went out upon my
balcony the next night at the same hour; but the light of her lamp
was bright within, no shadow obscured it, and no window opened. So,
after waiting for more than an hour, I gave her up, and returned to
my work. I did this for six nights in succession. On the seventh
she came.</p>
<p>"You are fond of your balcony, fellow-student," said she. "I
often hear you out here."</p>
<p>"My room gets heated," I replied, "and my eyes weary, after
several hours of hard reading; and this keen, clear air puts new
life into one's brains."</p>
<p>"Yes, it is delicious," said she, looking up into the night.
"How dark the space of heaven is, and, how bright are the stars!
What a night for the Alps! What a night to be upon some Alpine
height, watching the moon through a good telescope, and waiting for
the sunrise!"</p>
<p>"Defer that wish for a few months," I replied smiling. "You
would scarcely like Switzerland in her winter robes."</p>
<p>"Nay, I prefer Switzerland in winter," she said. "I passed
through part of the Jura about ten days ago, and saw nothing but
snow. It was magnificent--like a paradise of pure marble awaiting
the souls of all the sculptors of all the ages."</p>
<p>"A fantastic idea," said I, "and spoken like an artist."</p>
<p>"Like an artist!" she repeated, musingly. "Well, are not all
students artists?"</p>
<p>"Not those who study the exact sciences--not the student of law
or divinity--nor he who, like myself, is a student of medicine. He
is the slave of Fact, and Art is the Eden of his banishment. His
imagination is for ever captive. His horizon is for ever bounded.
He is fettered by routine, and paralyzed by tradition. His very
ideas must put on the livery of his predecessors; for in a
profession where originality of thought stands for the blackest
shade of original sin, skill--mere skill--must be the end of his
ambition."</p>
<p>She looked at me, and the moonlight showed me that sad smile
which her lips so often wore.</p>
<p>"You do not love your profession," she said.</p>
<p>"I do not, indeed."</p>
<p>"And yet you labor zealously to acquire it--how is that?"</p>
<p>"How is it with hundreds of others? My profession was chosen for
me. I am not my own master."</p>
<p>"But are you sure you would be happier in some other pursuit?
Supposing, for instance, that you were free to begin again, what
career do you think you would prefer?"</p>
<p>"I scarcely know, and I should scarcely care, so long as there
was freedom of thought and speculation in it."</p>
<p>"Geology, perhaps--or astronomy," she suggested, laughingly.</p>
<p>"Merci! The bowels of the earth are too profound, and the
heavens too lofty for me. I should choose some pursuit that would
set the Ariel of the imagination free. That is to say, I could be
very happy if my life were devoted to Science, but my soul echoes
to the name of Art."</p>
<p>"'The artist creates--the man of science discovers," said
Hortense. "Beware lest you fancy you would prefer the work of
creation only because you lack patience to pursue the work of
discovery. Pardon me, if I suggest that you may, perhaps, be fitted
for neither. Your sphere, I fancy, is
reflection--comparison--criticism. You are not made for action, or
work. Your taste is higher than your ambition, and you love
learning better than fame. Am I right?"</p>
<p>"So right that I regret I can be read so easily."</p>
<p>"And therefore, it may be that you would find yourself no
happier with Art than with Science. You might even fall into deeper
discouragement; for in Science every onward step is at least
certain gain, but in Art every step is groping, and success is only
another form of effort. Art, in so far as it is more divine, is
more unattainable, more evanescent, more unsubstantial. It needs as
much patience as Science, and the passionate devotion of an entire
life is as nothing in comparison with the magnitude of the work.
Self-sacrifice, self-distrust, infinite patience, infinite
disappointment--such is the lot of the artist, such the law of
aspiration."</p>
<p>"A melancholy creed."</p>
<p>"But a true one. The divine is doomed to suffering, and under
the hays of the poet lurk ever the thorns of the
self-immolator."</p>
<p>"But, amid all this record of his pains, do you render no
account of his pleasures?" I asked. "You forget that he has moments
of enjoyment lofty as his aims, and deep as his devotion.</p>
<p>"I do not forget it," she said. "I know it but too well. Alas!
is not the catalogue of his pleasures the more melancholy record of
the two? Hopes which sharpen disappointment; visions which cheat
while they enrapture; dreams that embitter his waking
hours--fellow-student, do you envy him these?"</p>
<p>"I do; believing that he would not forego them for a life of
common-place annoyances and placid pleasures."</p>
<p>"Forego them! Never. Who that had once been the guest of the
gods would forego the Divine for the Human? No--it is better to
suffer than to stagnate. The artist and poet is overpaid in his
brief snatches of joy. While they last, his soul sings 'at heaven's
gate,' and his forehead strikes the stars."</p>
<p>She spoke with a rare and passionate enthusiasm; sometimes
pacing to and fro; sometimes pausing with upturned face--</p>
<p>"A dauntless muse who eyes a dreadful fate!"</p>
<p>There was a long, long silence--she looking at the stars, I upon
her face.</p>
<p>By-and-by she came over to where I stood, and leaned upon the
railing that divided our separate territories.</p>
<p>"Friend," said she, gravely, "be content. Art is the Sphinx, and
to question her is destruction. Enjoy books, pictures, music,
statues--rifle the world of beauty to satiety, if satiety be
possible--but there pause Drink the wine; seek not to crush the
grape. Be happy, be useful, labor honestly upon the task that is
thine, and be assured that the work will itself achieve its reward.
Is it nothing to relieve pain--to prolong the days of the
sickly--to restore health to the suffering--to soothe the last
pangs of the dying? Is it nothing to be followed by the prayers and
blessing of those whom you have restored to love, to fame, to the
world's service? To my thinking, the physician's trade hath
something god-like in it. Be content. Harvey's discovery was as
sublime as Newton's, and it were hard to say which did God's work
best--Shakespeare or Jenner."</p>
<p>"And you," I said, the passion that I could not conceal
trembling in my voice; "and you--what are you, poet, or painter, or
musician, that you know and reason of all these things?"</p>
<p>She laughed with a sudden change of mood, and shook her
head.</p>
<p>"I am a woman," said she. "Simply a woman--no more. One of the
inferior sex; and, as I told you long ago, only half
civilized."</p>
<p>"You are unlike every other woman!"</p>
<p>"Possibly, because I am more useless. Strange as it may seem, do
you know I love art better than sewing, or gossip, or dress; and
hold my liberty to be a dower more precious than either beauty or
riches? And yet--I am a woman!"</p>
<p>"The wisest, virtuousest, discreetest, best!"</p>
<blockquote>&nbsp;"By no means. You are comparing me with Eve; but
I am<br>
not in the least like Eve, I assure you. She was an excellent
housewife, and, if we may believe Milton, knew how to prepare
'dulcet creams,' and all sorts of Paradisaical dainties for her
husband's dinner. I, on the contrary, could not make a cream if
Adam's life depended on it."</blockquote>
<p>"<i>Eh bien!</i> of the theology of creams I know nothing. I
only know that Eve was the first and fairest of her sex, and that
you are as wise as you are beautiful."</p>
<p>"Nay, that is what Titania said to the ass," laughed Hortense.
"Your compliments become equivocal, fellow-student. But hush! what
hour is that?"</p>
<p>She stood with uplifted finger. The air was keen, and over the
silence of the house-tops chimed the church-clocks--Two.</p>
<p>"It is late, and cold," said she, drawing her cloak more closely
round her.</p>
<p>"Not later than you usually sit up," I replied. "Don't go yet.
'Tis now the very witching hour of night, when churchyards
yawn--"</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon," she interrupted. "The churchyards have done
yawning by this time, and, like other respectable citizens, are
sound asleep. Let us follow their example. Good-night."</p>
<p>"Good-night," I replied, reluctantly; but almost before I had
said it, she was gone.</p>
<p>After this, as the winter wore away, and spring drew on,
Hortense's balcony became once more a garden, and she used to
attend to her flowers every evening. She always found me on my
balcony when she came out, and soon our open-air meetings became
such an established fact that, instead of parting with
"good-night," we said "<i>au revoir</i>--till to-morrow." At these
times we talked of many things; sometimes of subjects abstract and
mystical--of futurity, of death, of the spiritual life--but
oftenest of Art in its manifold developments. And sometimes our
speculations wandered on into the late hours of the night.</p>
<p>And yet, for all our talking and all our community of tastes, we
became not one jot more intimate. I still loved in silence--she
still lived in a world apart.</p>

AURORA LEIGH.</center>
<br>
<p>Abolished by the National Convention of 1793, re-established in
1795, reformed by the first Napoleon in 1803, and remodelled in
1816 on the restoration of the Bourbons, the Acad&eacute;mie
Fran&ccedil;aise, despite its changes of fortune, name, and
government, is a liberal and splendid institution. It consists of
forty members, whose office it is to compile the great dictionary,
and to enrich, purify, and preserve the language. It assists
authors in distress. It awards prizes for poetry, eloquence, and
virtue; and it bestows those honors with a noble impartiality that
observes no distinction of sex, rank, or party. To fill one of the
forty fauteuils of the Acad&eacute;mie Fran&ccedil;aise is the
darling ambition of every eminent Frenchman of letters. There the
poet, the philosopher, the historian, the man of science, sit side
by side, and meet on equal ground. When a seat falls vacant, when a
prize is to be awarded, when an anniversary is to be celebrated,
the interest and excitement become intense. To the political, the
fashionable, or the commercial world, these events are perhaps of
little moment. They affect neither the Bourse nor the Budget. They
exercise no perceptible influence on the Longchamps toilettes. But
to the striving author, to the rising orator, to all earnest
workers in the broad fields of literature, they are serious and
significant circumstances.</p>
<p>Living out of society as I now did, I knew little and cared less
for these academic crises. The success of one candidate was as
unimportant to me as the failure of another; and I had more than
once read the crowned poem of the prize essay without even glancing
at the name or the fortunate author.</p>
<p>Now it happened that, pacing to and fro under the budding
acacias of the Palais Royal garden one sunny spring-like morning,
some three or four weeks after the conversation last recorded, I
was pursued by a persecuting newsvender with a hungry eye, mittened
fingers, and a shrill voice, who persisted in reiterating close
against my ear:--</p>
<p>"News of the day, M'sieur!--news of the day. Frightful murder in
the Rue du Faubourg St. Antoine--state of the Bourse--latest
despatches from the seat of war--prize poem crowned by the
Acad&eacute;mie Fran&ccedil;aise--news of the day, M'sieur! Only
forty centimes! News of the day!"</p>
<p>I refused, however, to be interested in any of those topics,
turned a deaf ear to his allurements, and peremptorily dismissed
him. I then continued my walk in solitary silence.</p>
<p>At the further extremity of the square, near the <i>Galerie
Vitr&eacute;e</i> and close beside the little newspaper kiosk,
stood a large tree since cut down, which at that time served as an
advertising medium, and was daily decorated with a written placard,
descriptive of the contents of the <i>Moniteur</i>, the
<i>Presse</i>, and other leading papers. This placard was generally
surrounded by a crowd of readers, and to-day the crowd of readers
was more than usually dense.</p>
<p>I seldom cared in these days for what was going on in the busy
outside world; but this morning, my attention having been drawn to
the subject, I amused myself, as I paced to and fro, by watching
the eager faces of the little throng of idlers. Presently I fell in
with the rest, and found myself conning the placard on the
tree.</p>
<p>The name that met my astonished eyes on that placard was the
name of Hortense Dufresnoy.</p>
<p>The sentence ran thus:--</p>
<p>"Grand Biennial Prize for Poetry--Subject: <i>The Pass of
Thermopyl&aelig;</i>,--Successful Candidate, <i>Mademoiselle
Hortense Dufresnoy</i>."</p>
<p>Breathless, I read the passage twice; then, hearing at a little
distance the shrill voice of the importunate newsvender, I plunged
after him and stopped him, just as he came to the--</p>
<p>"Frightful murder in the Rue du Faubourg Saint ..."</p>
<p>"Here," said I, tapping him on the shoulder; "give me one of
your papers."</p>
<p>The man's eyes glittered.</p>
<p>"Only forty centimes, M'sieur," said he. "'Tis the first I've
sold to-day."</p>
<p>He looked poor and wretched. I dropped into his hand a coin that
would have purchased all his little sheaf of journals, and hurried
away, not to take the change or hear his thanks. He was silent for
some moments; then took up his cry at the point where he had broken
off, and started away with:--</p>
<p>--"Antoine!--state of the Bourse--latest despatches from the
seat of war--news of the day--only forty centimes!"</p>
<p>I took my paper to a quiet bench near the fountain, and read the
whole account. There had been eighteen anonymous poems submitted to
the Academy. Three out of the eighteen had come under discussion;
one out of the three had been warmly advocated by B&eacute;ranger,
one by Lebrun, and the third by some other academician. The poem
selected by Beranger was at length chosen; the sealed enclosure
opened; and the name of the successful competitor found to be
Hortense Dufresnoy. To Hortense Dufresnoy, therefore, the prize and
crown were awarded.</p>
<p>I read the article through, and then went home, hoping to be the
first to congratulate her. Timidly, and with a fast-beating heart,
I rang the bell at her outer door; for we all had our bells at
Madame Bou&iuml;sse's, and lived in our rooms as if they were
little private houses.</p>
<p>She opened the door, and, seeing me, looked surprised; for I had
never before ventured to pay her a visit in her apartment.</p>
<p>"I have come to wish you joy," said I, not venturing to cross
the threshold.</p>
<p>"To wish me joy?"</p>
<p>"You have not seen a morning paper?"</p>
<p>"A morning paper!"</p>
<p>And, echoing me thus, her color changed, and a strange vague
look--it might be of hope, it might be of fear--came into her
face.</p>
<p>"There is something in the <i>Moniteur</i>" I went on, smiling,
'that concerns you nearly."</p>
<p>"That concerns me?" she exclaimed. "<i>Me</i>? For Heaven's
sake, speak plainly. I do not understand you. Has--has anything
been discovered?"</p>
<p>"Yes--it has been discovered at the Acad&eacute;mie
Fran&ccedil;aise that Mademoiselle Hortense Dufresnoy has written
the best poem on Thermopyl&aelig;."</p>
<p>She drew a deep breath, pressed her hands tightly together, and
murmured:--</p>
<p>"Alas! is that all?"</p>
<p>"All! Nay--is it not enough to step at once into fame--to have
been advocated by B&eacute;ranger--to have the poem crowned in the
Theatre of the Acad&eacute;mie Fran&ccedil;aise?"</p>
<p>She stood silent, with drooping head and listless hands, all
disappointment and despondency. Presently she looked up.</p>
<p>"Where did you learn this?" she asked.</p>
<p>I handed her the journal.</p>
<p>"Come in, fellow-student," said she, and held the door wide for
me to enter.</p>
<p>For the second time I found myself in her little <i>salon</i>,
and found everything in the self-same order.</p>
<p>"Well," I said, "are you not happy?"</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>"Success is not happiness," she replied, smiling mournfully.
"That B&eacute;ranger should have advocated my poem is an honor
beyond price; but--but I need more than this to make me happy."</p>
<p>And her eyes wandered, with a strange, yearning look, to the
sword over the chimney-piece.</p>
<p>Seeing that look, my heart sank, and the tears sprang unbidden
to my eyes. Whose was the sword? For whose sake was her life so
lonely and secluded? For whom was she waiting? Surely here, if one
could but read it aright, lay the secret of her strange and sudden
journeys--here I touched unawares upon the mystery of her life!</p>
<p>I did not speak. I shaded my face with my hand, and sat looking
on the ground. Then, the silence remaining unbroken, I rose, and
examined the drawings on the walls.</p>
<p>They were water-colors for the most part, and treated in a
masterly but quite peculiar style. The skies were sombre, the
foregrounds singularly elaborate, the color stern and forcible.
Angry sunsets barred by lines of purple cirrus stratus; sweeps of
desolate heath bounded by jagged peaks; steep mountain passes
crimson with faded ferns and half-obscured by rain-clouds; strange
studies of weeds, and rivers, and lonely reaches of desolate
sea-shore ... these were some of the subjects, and all were
evidently by the same hand.</p>
<p>"Ah," said Hortense, "you are criticizing my sketches!"</p>
<p>"Your sketches!" I exclaimed. "Are these your work?"</p>
<p>"Certainly," she replied, smiling. "Why not? What do you think
of them?"</p>
<p>"What do I think of them! Well, I think that if you had not been
a poet you ought to have been a painter. How fortunate you are in
being able to express yourself so variously! Are these
compositions, or studies from Nature?"</p>
<p>"All studies from Nature--mere records of fact. I do not presume
to create--I am content humbly and from a distance to copy the
changing moods of Nature."</p>
<p>"Pray be your own catalogue, then, and tell me where these
places are."</p>
<p>"Willingly. This coast-line with the run of breaking surf was
taken on the shores of Normandy, some few miles from Dieppe. This
sunset is a recollection of a glorious evening near Frankfort, and
those purple mountains in the distance are part of the Taunus
range. Here is an old medi&aelig;val gateway at Solothurn, in
Switzerland. This wild heath near the sea is in the neighborhood of
Biscay. This quaint knot of ruinous houses in a weed-grown Court
was sketched at Bruges. Do you see that milk-girl with her scarlet
petticoat and Flemish <i>faille?</i> She supplied us with milk, and
her dairy was up that dark archway. She stood for me several times,
when I wanted a foreground figure."</p>
<p>"You have travelled a great deal," I said. "Were you long in
Belgium?"</p>
<p>"Yes; I lived there for some years. I was first pupil, then
teacher, in a large school in Brussels. I was afterwards governess
in a private family in Bruges. Of late, however, I have preferred
to live in Paris, and give morning lessons. I have more liberty
thus, and more leisure."</p>
<p>"And these two little quaint bronze figures?"</p>
<p>"Hans Sachs and Peter Vischer. I brought them from Nuremberg.
Hans Sachs, you see, wears a furred robe, and presses a book to his
breast. He does not look in the least like a cobbler. Peter
Vischer, on the contrary, wears his leather apron and carries his
mallet in his hand. Artist and iron-smith, he glories in his trade,
and looks as sturdy a little burgher as one would wish to see."</p>
<p>"And this statuette in green marble?"</p>
<p>"A copy of the celebrated 'Pensiero' of Michel Angelo--in other
words, the famous sitting statue of Lorenzo de Medici, in the
Medicean chapel in Florence. I had it executed for me on the spot
by Bazzanti."</p>
<p>"A noble figure!"</p>
<p>"Indeed it is--a noble figure, instinct with life, and strength,
and meditation. My first thought on seeing the original was that I
would not for worlds be condemned to pass a night alone with it. I
should every moment expect the musing hand to drop away from the
stern mouth, and the eyes to turn upon me!"</p>
<p>"These," said I, pausing at the chimney-piece, "are
<i>souvenirs</i> of Switzerland. How delicately those chamois are
carved out of the hard wood! They almost seem to snuff the mountain
air! But here is a rapier with a hilt of ornamented steel--where
did this come from?"</p>
<p>I had purposely led up the conversation to this point. I had
patiently questioned and examined for the sake of this one inquiry,
and I waited her reply as if my life hung on it.</p>
<p>Her whole countenance changed. She took it down, and her eyes
filled with tears.</p>
<p>"It was my father's," she said, tenderly.</p>
<p>"Your father's!" I exclaimed, joyfully. "Heaven be thanked! Did
you say your father's?"</p>
<p>She looked up surprised, then smiled, and faintly blushed.</p>
<p>"I did," she replied.</p>
<p>"And was your father a soldier?" I asked; for the sword looked
more like a sword of ceremony than a sword for service.</p>
<p>But to this question she gave no direct reply.</p>
<p>"It was his sword," she said, "and he had the best of all rights
to wear it."</p>
<p>With this she kissed the weapon reverently, and restored it to
its place.</p>
<p>I kissed her hand quite as reverently that day at parting, and
she did not withdraw it.</p>

<br>
AURORA LEIGH.</center>
<br>
<p>"God sent art, and the devil sent critics," said M&uuml;ller,
dismally paraphrasing a popular proverb. "My picture is
rejected!"</p>
<p>"Rejected!" I echoed, surprised to find him sitting on the
floor, like a tailor, in front of an acre of canvas. "By whom?"</p>
<p>"By the Hanging Committee."</p>
<p>"Hang the Hanging Committee!"</p>
<p>"A pious prayer, my friend. Would that it could be carried into
execution!"</p>
<p>"What cause do they assign?"</p>
<p>"Cause! Do you suppose they trouble themselves to find one? Not
a bit of it. They simply scrawl a great R in chalk on the back of
it, and send you a printed notice to carry it home again. What is
it to them, if a poor devil has been painting his very heart and
hopes out, day after day, for a whole year, upon that piece of
canvas? Nothing, and less than nothing--confound them!"</p>
<p>I drew a chair before the picture, and set myself to a patient
study of the details. He had chosen a difficult subject--the death
of Louis XI. The scene represented a spacious chamber in the Castle
of Plessisles-Tours. To the left, in a great oak chair beside the
bed from which he had just risen, sat the dying king, with a rich,
furred mantle loosely thrown around him. At his feet, his face
buried in his hands, kneeled the Dauphin. Behind his chair, holding
up the crucifix to enjoin silence, stood the king's confessor. A
physician, a couple of councillors in scarlet robes, and a captain
of archers, stood somewhat back, whispering together and watching
the countenance of the dying man; while through the outer door was
seen a crowd of courtiers and pages, waiting to congratulate King
Charles VIII. It was an ambitious subject, and M&uuml;ller had
conceived it in a grand spirit. The heads were expressive; and the
textures of the velvets, tapestries, oak carvings, and so forth,
had been executed with more than ordinary finish and fidelity. For
all this, however, there was more of promise than of achievement in
the work. The lights were scattered; the attitudes were stiff;
there was too evident an attempt at effect. One could see that it
was the work of a young painter, who had yet much to learn, and
something of the Academy to forget.</p>
<p>"Well," said M&uuml;ller, still sitting ruefully on the floor,
"what do you think of it? Am I rightly served? Shall I send for a
big pail of whitewash, and blot it all out?"</p>
<p>"Not for the world!"</p>
<p>"What shall I do, then?"</p>
<p>"Do better."</p>
<p>"But, if I have done my best already?"</p>
<p>"Still do better; and when you have done that, do better again.
So genius toils higher and ever higher, and like the climber of the
glacier, plants his foot where only his hand clung the moment
before."</p>
<p>"Humph! but what of my picture?"</p>
<p>"Well," I said, hesitatingly, "I am no critic--"</p>
<p>"Thank Heaven!" muttered M&uuml;ller, parenthetically.</p>
<p>"But there is something noble in the disposition of the figures.
I should say, however, that you had set to work upon too large a
scale."</p>
<p>"A question of focus," said the painter, hastily. "A mere
question of focus."</p>
<p>"How can that be, when you have finished some parts laboriously,
and in others seem scarcely to have troubled yourself to cover the
canvas?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. I'm impatient, you see, and--and I think I got
tired of it towards the last."</p>
<p>"Would that have been the case if you had allowed yourself but
half the space?"</p>
<p>"I'll take to enamel," exclaimed M&uuml;ller, with a grin of
hyperbolical despair. "I'll immortalize myself in miniature. I'll
paint henceforward with the aid of a microscope, and never again
look at nature unless through the wrong end of a telescope!"</p>
<p>"Pshaw!--be in earnest, man, and talk sensibly! Do you conceive
that for every failure you are to change your style? Give yourself,
heart and soul, to the school in which you have begun, and make up
your mind to succeed."</p>
<p>"Do you believe, then, that a man may succeed by force of will
alone?" said M&uuml;ller, musingly.</p>
<p>"Yes, because force of will proceeds from force of character,
and the two together, warp and woof, make the stuff out of which
Nature clothes her heroes."</p>
<p>"Oh, but I am not talking of heroes," said M&uuml;ller.</p>
<p>"By heroes, I do not mean only soldiers. Captain Pen is as good
a hero as Captain Sword, any day; and Captain Brush, to my
thinking, is as fine a fellow as either."</p>
<p>"Ay; but do they come, as you would seem to imply, of the same
stock?" said M&uuml;ller. "Force of will and force of character are
famous clays in which to mould a Wellington or a Columbus; but is
not something more--at all events, something different--necessary
to the modelling of a Raffaelle?"</p>
<p>"I don't fancy so. Power is the first requisite of genius. Give
power in equal quantity to your Columbus and your Raffaelle, and
circumstance shall decide which will achieve the New World, and
which the Transfiguration."</p>
<p>"Circumstance!" cried the painter, impatiently. "Good heavens!
do you make no account of the spontaneous tendencies of genius? Is
Nature a mere vulgar cook, turning out men, like soups, from one
common stock, with only a dash of flavoring here and there to give
them variety? No--Nature is a subtle chemist, and her workshop,
depend on it, is stored with delicate elixirs, volatile spirits,
and precious fires of genius. Certain of these are kneaded with the
clay of the poet, others with the clay of the painter, the
astronomer, the mathematician, the legislator, the soldier.
Raffaelle had in him some of 'the stuff that dreams are made of.'
Never tell me that that same stuff, differently treated, would
equally well have furnished forth an Archimedes or a Napoleon!"</p>
<p>"Men are what their age calls upon them to be," I replied, after
a moment's consideration. "Be that demand what it may, the supply
is ever equal to it. Centre of the most pompous and fascinating of
religions, Rome demanded Madonnas and Transfigurations, and
straightway Raffaelle answered to the call. The Old World,
overstocked with men, gold, and aristocracies, asked wider fields
of enterprise, and Columbus added America to the map. What is this
but circumstance? Had Italy needed colonies, would not her men of
genius have turned sailors and discoverers? Had Madrid been the
residence of the Popes, might not Columbus have painted
altar-pieces or designed churches?"</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller, still sitting on the floor, shook his head
despondingly.</p>
<p>"I don't think it," he replied; "and I don't wish to think it.
It is too material a view of genius to satisfy my imagination. I
love to believe that gifts are special. I love to believe that the
poet is born a poet, and the artist an artist."</p>
<p>"Hold! I believe that the poet is born a poet, and the artist an
artist; but I also believe the poetry of the one and the art of the
other to be only diverse manifestations of a power that is
universal in its application. The artist whose lot in life it is to
be a builder is none the less an artist. The poet, though engineer
or soldier, is none the less a poet. There is the poetry of
language, and there is also the poetry of action. So also there is
the art which expresses itself by means of marble or canvas, and
the art which designs a capitol, tapers a spire, or plants a
pleasure-ground. Nay, is not this very interfusion of gifts, this
universality of uses, in itself the bond of beauty which girdles
the world like a cestus? If poetry were only rhyme, and art only
painting, to what an outer darkness of matter-of-fact should we be
condemning nine-tenths of the creation!"</p>
<p>M&uuml;ller yawned, as if he would have swallowed me and my
argument together.</p>
<p>"You are getting transcendental," said he. "I dare say your
theories are all very fine and all very true; but I confess that I
don't understand them. I never could find out all this poetry of
bricks and mortar, railroads and cotton-factories, that people talk
about so fluently now-a-days. We Germans take the dreamy side of
life, and are seldom at home in the practical, be it ever so highly
colored and highly flavored. In our parlance, an artist is an
artist, and neither a bagman nor an engine-driver."</p>
<p>His professional pride was touched, and he said this with
somewhat less than his usual <i>bonhomie</i>--almost with a shade
of irritability.</p>
<p>"Come," said I, smiling, "we will not discuss a topic which we
can never see from the same point of view. Doing art is better than
talking art; and your business now is to find a fresh subject and
prepare another canvas. Meanwhile cheer up, and forget all about
Louis XI. and the Hanging Committee. What say you to dining with me
at the Trois Fr&egrave;res? It will do you good."</p>
<p>"Good!" cried he, springing to his feet and shaking his fist at
the picture. "More good, by Jupiter, than all the paint and megilp
that ever was wasted! Not all the fine arts of Europe are worth a
<i>poulet &agrave; la Marengo</i> and a bottle of old
<i>Roman&eacute;e</i>!"</p>
<p>So saying, he turned his picture to the wall, seized his cap,
locked his door, scrawled outside with a piece of
chalk,--"<i>Summoned to the Tuileries on state affairs</i>," and
followed me, whistling, down the six flights of gloomy, ricketty,
Quartier-Latin lodging-house stairs up which he lived and had his
being.</p>

<h3>I MAKE MYSELF ACQUAINTED WITH THE IMPOLITE WORLD<br>
AND ITS PLACES OP UNFASHIONABLE RESORT.</h3>
<br>
<p>M&uuml;ller and I dined merrily at the Caf&eacute; of the Trois
Fr&egrave;res Proven&ccedil;aux, discussed our coffee and cigars
outside the Rotonde in the Palais Royal, and then started off in
search of adventures. Striking up in a north-easterly direction
through a labyrinth of narrow streets, we emerged at the Rue des
Fontaines, just in front of that famous second-hand market yclept
the Temple. It was Saturday night, and the business of the place
was at its height. We went in, and turning aside from the broad
thoroughfares which intersect the market at right angles, plunged
at once into a net-work of crowded side-alleys, noisy and populous
as a cluster of beehives. Here were bargainings, hagglings,
quarrellings, elbowings, slang, low wit, laughter, abuse, cheating,
and chattering enough to turn the head of a neophyte like myself.
M&uuml;ller, however, was in his element. He took me up one row and
down another, pointed out all that was curious, had a nod for every
grisette, and an answer for every touter, and enjoyed the Babel
like one to the manner born.</p>
<p>"Buy, messieurs, buy! What will you buy?" was the question that
assailed us on both sides, wherever we went.</p>
<p>"What do you sell, <i>mon ami ?</i>" was M&uuml;ller's
invariable reply.</p>
<p>"What do you want, m'sieur?"</p>
<p>"Twenty thousand francs per annum, and the prettiest wife in
Paris," says my friend; a reply which is sure to evoke something
<i>spirituel</i>, after the manner of the locality.</p>
<p>"This is the most amusing place in Paris," observes he. "Like
the Alsatia of old London, it has its own peculiar <i>argot,</i>
and its own peculiar privileges. The activity of its commerce is
amazing. If you buy a pocket-handkerchief at the first stall you
come to, and leave it unprotected in your coat-pocket for five
minutes, you may purchase it again at the other end of the alley
before you leave. As for the resources of the market, they are
inexhaustible. You may buy anything you please here, from a Court
suit to a cargo of old rags. In this alley (which is the
aristocratic quarter), are sold old jewelry, old china, old
furniture, silks that have rustled at the Tuileries; fans that may
have fluttered at the opera; gloves once fitted to tiny hands, and
yet bearing a light soil where the rings were worn beneath; laces
that may have been the property of Countesses or Cardinals;
masquerade suits, epaulets, uniforms, furs, perfumes, artificial
flowers, and all sorts of elegant superfluities, most of which have
descended to the merchants of the Temple through the hands of
ladies-maids and valets. Yonder lies the district called the
'For&ecirc;t Noire'--a land of unpleasing atmosphere inhabited by
cobblers and clothes-menders. Down to the left you see nothing but
rag and bottle-shops, old iron stores, and lumber of every kind.
Here you find chiefly household articles, bedding, upholstery,
crockery, and so forth."</p>
<p>"What will you buy, Messieurs?" continued to be the cry, as we
moved along arm-in-arm, elbowing our way through the crowd, and
exploring this singular scene in all directions.</p>
<p>"What will you buy, messieurs?" shouts one salesman. "A carpet?
A capital carpet, neither too large nor too small. Just the size
you want!"</p>
<p>"A hat, m'sieur, better than new," cries another; "just aired by
the last owner."</p>
<p>"A coat that will fit you better than if it had been made for
you?"</p>
<p>"A pair of boots? Dress-boots, dancing-boots, walking-boots,
morning-boots, evening-boots, riding-boots, fishing-boots,
hunting-boots. All sorts, m'sieur--all sorts!"</p>
<p>"A cloak, m'sieur?"</p>
<p>"A lace shawl to take home to Madame?"</p>
<p>"An umbrella, m'sieur?"</p>
<p>"A reading lamp?"</p>
<p>"A warming-pan?"</p>
<p>"A pair of gloves?"</p>
<p>"A shower bath?"</p>
<p>"A hand organ?"</p>
<p>"What! m'sieurs, do you buy nothing this evening? Hol&agrave;,
Antoine! monsieur keeps his hands in his pockets, for fear his
money should fall out!"</p>
<p>"Bah! They've not a centime between them!"</p>
<p>"Go down the next turning and have the hole in your coat
mended!"</p>
<p>"Make way there for monsieur the millionaire!"</p>
<p>"They are ambassadors on their way to the Court of Persia."</p>
<p>"<i>Ohe! Pan&egrave;! pan&egrave;! pan&egrave;!</i>"</p>
<p>Thus we run the gauntlet of all the tongues in the Temple,
sometimes retorting, sometimes laughing and passing on, sometimes
stopping to watch the issue of a dispute or the clinching of a
bargain.</p>
<p>"<i>Dame</i>, now! if it were only ten francs cheaper," says a
voice that strikes my ear with a sudden sense of familiarity.
Turning, I discover that the voice belongs to a young woman close
at my elbow, and that the remark is addressed to a good-looking
workman upon whose arm she is leaning.</p>
<p>"What, Josephine!" I exclaim.</p>
<p>"<i>Comment</i>! Monsieur Basil!"</p>
<p>And I find myself kissed on both cheeks before I even guess what
is going to happen to me.</p>
<p>"Have I not also the honor of being remembered by Mademoiselle?"
says M&uuml;ller, taking off his hat with all the politeness
possible; whereupon Josephine, in an ecstasy of recognition,
embraces him likewise.</p>
<p>"<i>Mais, quel bonheur</i>!" cries she. "And to meet in the
Temple, above all places! Emile, you heard me speak of Monsieur
Basil--the gentleman who gave me that lovely shawl that I wore last
Sunday to the Ch&acirc;teau des Fleurs--<i>eh bien</i>! this is
he--and here is Monsieur M&uuml;ller, his friend. Gentlemen, this
is Emile, my <i>fianc&eacute;</i>. We are to be married next Friday
week, and we are buying our furniture."</p>
<p>The good-looking workman pulled off his cap and made his bow,
and we proffered the customary congratulations.</p>
<p>"We have bought such sweet, pretty things," continued she,
rattling on with all her old volubility, "and we have hired the
dearest little <i>appartement</i> on the fourth story, in a street
near the Jardin des Plantes. See--this looking-glass is ours; we
have just bought it. And those maple chairs, and that chest of
drawers with the marble top. It isn't real marble, you know; but
it's ever so much better than real:--not nearly so heavy, and so
beautifully carved that it's quite a work of art. Then we have
bought a carpet--the sweetest carpet! Is it not, Emile?"</p>
<p>Emile smiled, and confessed that the carpet was "<i>fort
bien</i>."</p>
<p>"And the time-piece, Madame?" suggested the furniture-dealer, at
whose door we were standing. "Madame should really not refuse
herself the time-piece."</p>
<p>Josephine shook her head.</p>
<p>"It is too dear," said she.</p>
<p>"Pardon, madame. I am giving it away,--absolutely giving it away
at the price!"</p>
<p>Josephine looked at it wistfully, and weighed her little purse.
It was a very little purse, and very light.</p>
<p>"It is so pretty!" said she.</p>
<p>The clock was of ormolu upon a painted stand, that was
surmounted by a stout little gilt Cupid in a triumphal chariot,
drawn by a pair of hard-working doves.</p>
<p>"What is the price of it?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Thirty-five francs, m'sieur," replied the dealer, briskly.</p>
<p>"Say twenty-five," urged Josephine.</p>
<p>The dealer shook his head.</p>
<p>"What if we did without the looking-glass?" whispered Josephine
to her <i>fianc&eacute;</i>. "After all, you know, one can live
without a looking-glass; but how shall I have your dinners ready,
if I don't know what o'clock it is?"</p>
<p>"I don't really see how we are to do without a clock," admitted
Emile.</p>
<p>"And that darling little Cupid!"</p>
<p>Emile conceded that the Cupid was irresistible.</p>
<p>"Then we decide to have the clock, and do without the
looking-glass?"</p>
<p>"Yes, we decide."</p>
<p>In the meantime I had slipped the thirty-five francs into the
dealer's hand.</p>
<p>"You must do me the favor to accept the clock as a
wedding-present, Mademoiselle Josephine," I said. "And I hope you
will favor me with an invitation to the wedding."</p>
<p>"And me also," said M&uuml;ller; "and I shall hope to be allowed
to offer a little sketch to adorn the walls of your new home."</p>
<p>Their delight and gratitude were almost too great. We shook
hands again all round. I am not sure, indeed, that Josephine did
not then and there embrace us both for the second time.</p>
<p>"And you will both come to our wedding!" cried she. "And we will
spend the day at St. Cloud, and have a dance in the evening; and we
will invite Monsieur Gustave, and Monsieur Jules, and Monsieur
Adrien. Oh, dear! how delightful it will be!"</p>
<p>"And you promise me the first quadrille?" said I.</p>
<p>"And me the second?" added M&uuml;ller.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes--as many as you please."</p>
<p>"Then you must let us know at what time to come, and all about
it; so, till Friday week, adieu!"</p>
<p>And thus, with more shaking of hands, and thanks, and good
wishes, we parted company, leaving them still occupied with the
gilt Cupid and the furniture-broker.</p>
<p>After the dense atmosphere of the clothes-market, it is a relief
to emerge upon the Boulevart du Temple--the noisy, feverish,
crowded Boulevart du Temple, with its half dozen theatres, its
glare of gas, its cake-sellers, bill-sellers, lemonade-sellers,
cabs, caf&eacute;s, gendarmes, tumblers, grisettes, and
pleasure-seekers of both sexes.</p>
<p>Here we pause awhile to applaud the performances of a company of
dancing-dogs, whence we are presently drawn away by the sight of a
gentleman in a <i>moyen-&acirc;ge</i> costume, who is swallowing
penknives and bringing them out at his ears to the immense
gratification of a large circle of bystanders.</p>
<p>A little farther on lies the Jardin Turc; and here we drop in
for half an hour, to restore ourselves with coffee-ices, and look
on at the dancers. This done, we presently issue forth again, still
in search of amusement.</p>
<p>"Have you ever been to the Petit Lazary?" asks my friend, as we
stand at the gate of the Jardin Turc, hesitating which way to
turn.</p>
<p>"Never; what is it?"</p>
<p>"The most inexpensive of theatrical luxuries--an evening's
entertainment of the mildest intellectual calibre, and at the
lowest possible cost. Here we are at the doors. Come in, and
complete your experience of Paris life!"</p>
<p>The Petit Lazary occupies the lowest round of the theatrical
ladder. We pay something like sixpence half-penny or sevenpence
apiece, and are inducted into the dress-circle. Our appearance is
greeted with a round of applause. The curtain has just fallen, and
the audience have nothing better to do. M&uuml;ller lays his hand
upon his heart, and bows profoundly, first to the gallery and next
to the pit; whereupon they laugh, and leave us in peace. Had we
looked dignified or indignant we should probably have been hissed
till the curtain rose.</p>
<p>It is an audience in shirt-sleeves, consisting for the most part
of workmen, maid-servants, soldiers, and street-urchins, with a
plentiful sprinkling of pickpockets--the latter in a strictly
private capacity, being present for entertainment only, without any
ulterior professional views.</p>
<p>It is a noisy <i>entr'acte</i> enough. Three vaudevilles have
already been played, and while the fourth is in preparation the
public amuses itself according to its own riotous will and
pleasure. Nuts and apple parings fly hither and thither; oranges
describe perilous parabolas between the pit and the gallery;
adventurous <i>gamins</i> make daring excursions round the upper
rails; dialogues maintained across the house, and quarrels
supported by means of an incredible copiousness of invective,
mingle in discordant chorus with all sorts of howlings, groanings,
whistlings, crowings, and yelpings, above which, in shrillest
treble, rise the voices of cake and apple-sellers, and the piercing
cry of the hump-back who distributes "vaudevilles at five centimes
apiece." In the meantime, almost distracted by the patronage that
assails him in every direction, the lemonade-vendor strides hither
and thither, supplying floods of nectar at two centimes the glass;
while the audience, skilled in the combination of enjoyments, eats,
drinks, and vociferates to its heart's content. Fabulous meats, and
pies of mysterious origin, are brought out from baskets and hats.
Pocket-handkerchiefs spread upon benches do duty as table-cloths.
Clasp-knives, galette, and sucre d'orge pass from hand to
hand--nay, from mouth to mouth--and, in the midst of the tumult,
the curtain rises.</p>
<p>All is, in one moment, profoundly silent. The viands disappear;
the lemonade-seller vanishes; the boys outside the gallery-rails
clamber back to their places. The drama, in the eyes of the
Parisians, is almost a sacred rite, and not even the noisiest
<i>gamin</i> would raise his voice above a whisper when the curtain
is up.</p>
<p>The vaudeville that follows is, to say the least of it, a
perplexing performance. It has no plot in particular. The scene is
laid in a lodging-house, and the discomforts of one Monsieur
Choufleur, an elderly gentleman in a flowered dressing-gown and a
gigantic nightcap, furnish forth all the humor of the piece. What
Monsieur Choufleur has done to deserve his discomforts, and why a
certain student named Charles should devote all the powers of his
mind to the devising and inflicting of those discomforts, is a
mystery which we, the audience, are never permitted to penetrate.
Enough that Charles, being a youth of mischievous tastes and
extensive wardrobe, assumes a series of disguises for the express
purpose of tormenting Monsieur Choufleur, and is unaccountably
rewarded in the end with the hand of Monsieur Choufleur's daughter;
a consummation which brings down the curtain amid loud applause,
and affords entire satisfaction to everybody.</p>
<p>It is by this time close upon midnight, and, leaving the theatre
with the rest of the audience, we find a light rain falling. The
noisy thoroughfare is hushed to comparative quiet. The carriages
that roll by are homeward bound. The waiters yawn at the doors of
the caf&eacute;s and survey pedestrians with a threatening aspect.
The theatres are closing fast, and a row of flickering gas-lamps in
front of a faded transparency which proclaims that the juvenile
<i>Tableaux Vivants</i> are to be seen within, denotes the only
place of public amusement yet open to the curious along the whole
length of the Boulevart du Temple.</p>
<p>"And now, <i>amigo</i>, where shall we go?" says M&uuml;ller.
"Are you for a billiard-room or a lobster supper? Or shall we beat
up the quarters of some of the fellows in the Quartier Latin, and
see what fun is afoot on the other side of the water?"</p>
<p>"Whichever you please. You are my guest to-night, and I am at
your disposal."</p>
<p>"Or what say you to dropping in for an hour among the
Chicards?"</p>
<p>"A capital idea--especially if you again entertain the society
with a true story of events that never happened."</p>
<p>"<i>Allons donc</i>!--</p>
<blockquote>'C'&eacute;tait de mon temps<br>
Que brillait Madame Gr&eacute;goire.<br>
J'allais &agrave; vingt ans<br>
Dans son cabaret rire et boire.'</blockquote>
<p>--confound this drizzle! It soaks one through and through, like
a sponge. If you are no fonder of getting wet through than I am, I
vote we both run for it!"</p>
<p>With this he set off running at full speed, and I followed.</p>
<p>The rain soon fell faster and thicker. We had no umbrellas; and
being by this time in a region of back-streets, an empty fiacre was
a prize not to be hoped for. Coming presently to a dark archway, we
took shelter and waited till the shower should pass over. It lasted
longer than we had expected, and threatened to settle into a
night's steady rain. M&uuml;ller kept his blood warm by practicing
extravagant quadrille steps and singing scraps of B&eacute;ranger's
ballads; whilst I, watching impatiently for a cab, kept peering up
and down the street, and listening to every sound.</p>
<p>Presently a quick footfall echoed along the wet pavement, and
the figure of a man, dimly seen by the blurred light of the
street-lamps, came hurrying along the other side of the way.
Something in the firm free step, in the upright carriage, in the
height and build of the passer-by, arrested my attention. He drew
nearer. He passed under the lamp just opposite, and, as he passed,
flung away the end of his cigar, which fell, hissing, into the
little rain-torrent running down the middle of the street. He
carried no umbrella; but his hat was pulled low, and his collar
drawn up, and I could see nothing of his face. But the gesture was
enough.</p>
<p>For a moment I stood still and looked after him; then, calling
to M&uuml;ller that I should be back presently, I darted off in
pursuit.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIX."></a>CHAPTER XLIX.</h2>
<h3>THE KING OF DIAMONDS.</h3>
<br>
<p>The rain beat in my face and almost blinded me, the wind hustled
me; the gendarme at the corner of the street looked at me
suspiciously; and still I followed, and still the tall stranger
strode on ahead. Up one street he led me and down another, across a
market-place, through an arcade, past the Bourse, and into that
labyrinth of small streets that lies behind the Italian
Opera-house, and is bounded on the East by the Rue de Richelieu,
and on the West by the Rue Louis le Grand. Here he slackened his
pace, and I found myself gaming upon him for the first time.
Presently he came to a dead stop, and as I continued to draw
nearer, I saw him take out his watch and look at it by the light of
a street-lamp. This done, he began sauntering slowly backwards and
forwards, as if waiting for some second person.</p>
<p>For a moment I also paused, hesitating. What should I do?--pass
him under the lamp, and try to see his face? Go boldly up to him,
and invent some pretence to address him, or wait in this angle of
deep shade, and see what would happen next? I was deceived, of
course--deceived by a merely accidental resemblance. Well, then, I
should have had my run for my pains, and have taken cold, most
likely, into the bargain. At all events, I would speak to him.</p>
<p>Seeing me emerge from the darkness, and cross over towards the
spot where he was standing, he drew aside with the air of a man
upon his guard, and put his hand quickly into his breast.</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon, Monsieur," I began.</p>
<p>"What! my dear Damon!--is it you?" he interrupted, and held out
both hands.</p>
<p>I grasped them joyously.</p>
<p>"Dalrymple, is it you?"</p>
<p>"Myself, Damon--<i>faute de mieux</i>."</p>
<p>"And I have been running after you for the last two miles! What
brings you to Paris? Why did you not let me know you were here? How
long have you been back? Has anything gone wrong? Are you
well?"</p>
<p>"One question at a time, my Arcadian, for mercy's sake!" said
he. "Which am I to answer?"</p>
<p>"The last."</p>
<p>"Oh, I am well--well enough. But let us walk on a little farther
while we talk."</p>
<p>"Are you waiting for any one?" I asked, seeing him look round
uneasily.</p>
<p>"Yes--no--that is, I expect to see some one come past here
presently. Step into this doorway, and I will tell you all about
it."</p>
<p>His manner was restless, and his hand, as it pressed mine, felt
hot and feverish.</p>
<p>"I am sure you are not well," I said, following him into the
gloom of a deep, old-fashioned doorway.</p>
<p>"Am I not? Well, I don't know--perhaps I am not. My blood burns
in my veins to-night like fire. Nay, thou wilt learn nothing from
my pulse, thou sucking &AElig;sculapius! Mine is a sickness not to
be cured by drugs. I must let blood for it."</p>
<p>The short, hard laugh with which he said this troubled me still
more.</p>
<p>"Speak out," I said--"for Heaven's sake, speak out! You have
something on your mind--what is it?"</p>
<p>"I have something on my hands," he replied, gloomily. "Work.
Work that must be done quickly, or there will be no peace for any
of us. Look here, Damon--if you had a wife, and another man stood
before the world as her betrothed husband--if you had a wife, and
another man spoke of her as his--boasted of her--behaved in the
house as if it were already his own--treated her servants as though
he were their master--possessed himself of her papers--extorted
money from her--brought his friends, on one pretext or another,
about her house--tormented her, day after day, to marry him ...
what would you do to such a man as this?"</p>
<p>"Make my own marriage public at once, and set him at defiance,"
I replied.</p>
<p>"Ay, but...."</p>
<p>"But what?"</p>
<p>"That alone will not content me. I must punish him with my own
hand."</p>
<p>"He would be punished enough in the loss of the lady and her
fortune."</p>
<p>"Not he! He has entangled her affairs sufficiently by this time
to indemnify himself for her fortune, depend on it. And as for
herself--pshaw! he does not know what love is!"</p>
<p>"But his pride----"</p>
<p>"But <i>my</i> pride!" interrupted Dalrymple, passionately.
"What of my pride?--my wounded honor?--my outraged love? No, no, I
tell you, it is not such a paltry vengeance that will satisfy me!
Would to Heaven I had trusted only my own arm from the first! Would
to Heaven that, instead of having anything to say to the cursed
brood of the law, I had taken the viper by the throat, and brought
him to my own terms, after my own fashion!"</p>
<p>"But you have not yet told me what you are doing here?"</p>
<p>"I am waiting to see Monsieur de Simoncourt."</p>
<p>"Monsieur de Simoncourt!"</p>
<p>"Yes. That white house at the corner is one of his haunts,--a
private gaming-house, never open till after midnight. I want to
meet him accidentally, as he is going in."</p>
<p>"What for?"</p>
<p>"That he may take me with him. You can't get into one of these
places without an introduction, you know. Those who keep them are
too much afraid of the police."</p>
<p>"But do you play?"</p>
<p>"Come with me, and see. Hark! do you hear nothing?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I hear a footstep. And here comes a man."</p>
<p>"Let us walk to meet him, accidentally, and seem to be
talking."</p>
<p>I took Dalrymple's arm, and we strolled in the direction of the
new comer. It was not De Simoncourt, however, but a tall man with a
grizzled beard, who crossed over, apprehensively, at our approach,
but recrossed and went into the white house at the corner as soon
as he thought us out of sight.</p>
<p>"One of the gang," said Dalrymple, with a shrug of his broad
shoulders. "We had better go back to our doorway, and wait till the
right man comes."</p>
<p>We had not long to wait. The next arrival was he whom we sought.
We strolled on, as before, and came upon him face to face.</p>
<p>"De Simoncourt, by all that's propitious!" cried Dalrymple.</p>
<p>"What--Major Dalrymple returned to Paris!"</p>
<p>"Ay, just returned. Bored to death with Berlin and Vienna--no
place like Paris, De Simoncourt, go where one will!"</p>
<p>"None, indeed. There is but one Paris, and pleasure is the true
profit of all who visit it."</p>
<p>"My dear De Simoncourt, I am appalled to hear you perpetrate a
pun! By the way, you have met Mr. Basil Arbuthnot at my rooms?"</p>
<p>M. de Simoncourt lifted his hat, and was graciously pleased to
remember the circumstance.</p>
<p>"And now," pursued Dalrymple, "having met, what shall, we do
next? Have you any engagement for the small hours, De
Simoncourt?"</p>
<p>"I am quite at your disposal. Where were your bound for?"</p>
<p>"Anywhere--everywhere. I want excitement."</p>
<p>"Would a hand at <i>&eacute;cart&eacute;</i>, or a green table,
have any attraction for you?" suggested De Simoncourt, falling into
the trap as readily as one could have desired.</p>
<p>"The very thing, if you know where they are to be found!"</p>
<p>"Nay, I need not take you far to find both. There is in this
very street a house where money may be lost and won as easily as at
the Bourse. Follow me."</p>
<p>He took us to the white house at the corner, and, pressing a
spring concealed in the wood-work of the lintel, rung a bell of
shrill and peculiar <i>timbre</i>. The door opened immediately,
and, after we had passed in, closed behind us without any visible
agency. Still following at the heels of M. de Simoncourt, we then
went up a spacious staircase dimly lighted, and, leaving our hats
in an ante-room, entered unannounced into an elegant <i>salon</i>,
where some twenty or thirty <i>habitu&eacute;s</i> of both sexes
had already commenced the business of the evening. The ladies, of
whom there were not more than half-a-dozen, were all more or less
painted, <i>pass&eacute;es</i>, and showily dressed. Among the men
were military stocks, ribbons, crosses, stars, and fine titles in
abundance. We were evidently supposed to be in very brilliant
society--brilliant, however, with a fictitious lustre that betrayed
the tinsel beneath, and reminded one of a fashionable reception on
the boards of the Haymarket or the Porte St. Martin. The mistress
of the house, an abundant and somewhat elderly Juno in green
velvet, with a profusion of jewelry on her arms and bosom, came
forward to receive us.</p>
<p>"Madame de Sainte Amaranthe, permit me to present my friends,
Major Dalrymple and Mr. Arbuthnot," said De Simoncourt, imprinting
a gallant kiss on the plump hand of the hostess.</p>
<p>Madame de Ste. Amaranthe professed herself charmed to receive
any friends of M. de Simoncourt; whereupon M. de Simoncourt's
friends were enchanted to be admitted to the privilege of Madame de
Ste. Amaranthe's acquaintance. Madame de Ste. Amaranthe then
informed us that she was the widow of a general officer who fell at
Austerlitz, and the daughter of a rich West India planter whom she
called her <i>p&egrave;re ador&eacute;</i>, and to whose
supposititious memory she wiped away an imaginary tear with an
embroidered pocket-handkerchief. She then begged that we would make
ourselves at home, and, gliding away, whispered something in De
Simoncourt's ear, to which he replied by a nod of intelligence.</p>
<p>"That harpy hopes to fleece us," said Dalrymple, slipping his
arm through mine and drawing me towards the roulette table. "She
has just told De Simoncourt to take us in hand. I always suspected
the fellow was a Greek."</p>
<p>"A Greek?"</p>
<p>"Ay, in the figurative sense--a gentleman who lives by dexterity
at cards."</p>
<p>"And shall you play?"</p>
<p>"By-and-by. Not yet, because--"</p>
<p>He checked himself, and looked anxiously round the room.</p>
<p>"Because what?"</p>
<p>"Tell me, Arbuthnot," said he, paying no attention to my
question; "do <i>you</i> mind playing?"</p>
<p>"I? My dear fellow, I hardly know one card from another."</p>
<p>"But have you any objection?"</p>
<p>"None whatever to the game; but a good deal to the penalty. I
don't mind confessing to you that I ran into debt some months back,
and that...."</p>
<p>"Nonsense, boy!" interrupted Dalrymple, with a kindly smile. "Do
you suppose I want you to gamble away your money? No, no--the fact
is, that I am here for a purpose, and it will not do to let my
purpose be suspected. These Greeks want a pigeon. Will you oblige
me by being that pigeon, and by allowing me to pay for your
plucking?"</p>
<p>I still hesitated.</p>
<p>"But you will be helping me," urged he. "If you don't sit down,
I must."</p>
<p>"You would not lose so much," I expostulated.</p>
<p>"Perhaps not, if I were cool and kept my eyes open; but to-night
I am <i>distrait</i>, and should be as defenceless as
yourself."</p>
<p>"In that case I will play for you with pleasure."</p>
<p>He slipped a little pocket-book into my hand.</p>
<p>"Never stake more than five francs at a time," said he, "and you
cannot ruin me. The book contains a thousand. You shall have more,
if necessary; but I think that sum will last as long as I shall
want you to keep playing."</p>
<p>"A thousand francs!" I exclaimed. "Why, that is forty
pounds!"</p>
<p>"If it were four hundred, and it answered my purpose," said
Dalrymple, between his teeth, "I should hold it money well
spent!"</p>
<p>At this moment De Simoncourt came up, and apologized for having
left us so long.</p>
<p>"If you want mere amusement, Major Dalrymple," said he, "I
suppose you will prefer <i>roulette</i> to
<i>&eacute;cart&eacute;</i>!"</p>
<p>"I will stake a few pieces presently on the green cloth,"
replied Dalrymple, carelessly; "but, first of all, I want to
initiate my young friend here. As to double
<i>&eacute;cart&eacute;</i>, Monsieur de Simoncourt, I need hardly
tell you, as a man of the world, that I never play it with
strangers."</p>
<p>De Simoncourt smiled, and shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>"Quite right," said he. "I believe that here everything is
really <i>de bonne foi</i>; but where there are cards there will
always be danger. For my part, I always shuffle the pack after my
adversary!"</p>
<p>With this he strolled off again, and I took a vacant chair at
the long table, next to a lady, who made way for me with the most
gracious smile imaginable. Only the players sat; so Dalrymple stood
behind me and looked on. It was a green board, somewhat larger than
an ordinary billiard-table, with mysterious boundaries traced here
and there in yellow and red, and a cabalistic table of figures
towards each end. A couple of well-dressed men sat in the centre;
one to deal out the cards, and the other to pay and receive the
money. The one who had the management of the cash wore a superb
diamond ring, and a red and green ribbon at his button-hole.
Dalrymple informed me in a whisper that this noble seigneur was
Madame de Ste. Amaranthe's brother.</p>
<p>As for the players, they all looked serious and polite enough,
as ladies and gentlemen should, at their amusement. Some had pieces
of card, which they pricked occasionally with a pin, according to
the progress of the game. Some had little piles of silver, or
sealed <i>rouleaux</i>, lying beside them. As for myself, I took
out Dalrymple's pocket-book, and laid it beside me, as if I were an
experienced player and meant to break the bank. For a few minutes
he stood by, and then, having given me some idea of the leading
principles of the game, wandered away to observe the other
players.</p>
<p>Left to myself, I played on--timidly at first; soon with more
confidence; and, of course, with the novice's invariable
good-fortune. My amiable neighbor drew me presently into
conversation. She had a theory of chances relating to averages of
color, and based upon a bewildering calculation of all the black
and red cards in the pack, which she was so kind as to explain to
me. I could not understand a word of it, but politeness compelled
me to listen. Politeness also compelled me to follow her advice
when she was so obliging as to offer it, and I lost, as a matter of
course. From this moment my good-luck deserted me.</p>
<p>"Courage, Monsieur," said my amiable neighbour; "you have only
to play long enough, and you are sure to win."</p>
<p>In the meantime, I kept following Dalrymple with my eyes, for
there was something in his manner that filled me with vague
uneasiness. Sometimes he drew near the table and threw down a
Napoleon, but without heeding the game, or caring whether he won or
lost. He was always looking to the door, or wandering restlessly
from table to table. Watching him thus, I thought how haggard he
looked, and what deep channels were furrowed in his brow since that
day when we lay together on the autumnal grass under the trees in
the forest of St. Germain.</p>
<p>Thus a long time went by, and I found by my watch that it was
nearly four o'clock in the morning--also that I had lost six
hundred francs out of the thousand. It seemed incredible. I could
hardly believe that the time and the money had flown so fast. I
rose in my seat and looked round for Dalrymple; but in vain. Could
he be gone, leaving me here? Impossible! Apprehensive of I knew not
what, I pushed back my chair, and left the table. The rooms were
now much fuller--more stars and moustachios; more velvets and
laces, and Paris diamonds. Fresh tables, too, had been opened for
<i>lansquenet, baccarat</i>, and <i>&eacute;cart&eacute;</i>. At
one of these I saw M. de Simoncourt. When he laid down his cards
for the deal, I seized the opportunity to inquire for my
friend.</p>
<p>He pointed to a small inner room divided by a rich hanging from
the farther end of the <i>salon</i>.</p>
<p>"You will find Major Dalrymple in Madame de Ste. Amaranthe's
boudoir, playing with M. le Vicomte de Caylus," said he,
courteously, and resumed his game.</p>
<p>Playing with De Caylus! Sitting down amicably with De Caylus! I
could not understand it.</p>
<p>Crowded as the rooms now were, it took me some time to thread my
way across, and longer still, when I had done so, to pass the
threshold of the boudoir, and obtain sight of the players. The room
was very small, and filled with lookers-on. At a table under a
chandelier sat De Caylus and Dalrymple. I could not see Dalrymple's
face, for his back was turned towards me; but the Vicomte I
recognised at once--pale, slight, refined, with the old look of
dissipation and irritability, and the same restlessness of eye and
hand that I had observed on first seeing him. They were evidently
playing high, and each had a pile of notes and gold lying at his
left hand. De Caylus kept nervously crumbling a note in his
fingers. Dalrymple sat motionless as a man of bronze, and, except
to throw down a card when it came to his turn, never stirred a
finger. There was, to my thinking, something ominous in his
exceeding calmness.</p>
<p>"At what game are they, playing?" I asked a gentleman near whom
I was standing.</p>
<p>"At <i>&eacute;cart&eacute;</i>," replied he, without removing
his eyes from the players.</p>
<p>Knowing nothing of the game, I could only judge of its progress
by the faces of those around me. A breathless silence prevailed,
except when some particular subtlety in the play sent a murmur of
admiration round the room. Even this was hushed almost as soon as
uttered. Gradually the interest grew more intense, and the
bystanders pressed closer. De Caylus sighed impatiently, and passed
his hand across his brow. It was his turn to deal. Dalrymple
shuffled the pack. De Caylus shuffled them after him, and dealt.
The falling of a pin might have been heard in the pause that
followed. They had but five cards each. Dalrymple played first--a
queen of diamonds. De Caylus played the king, and both threw down
their cards. A loud murmur broke out instantaneously in every
direction, and De Caylus, looking excited and weary, leaned back in
his chair, and called for wine. His expression was so unlike that
of a victor that I thought at first he must have lost the game.</p>
<p>"Which is the winner?" I asked, eagerly. "Which is the
winner?"</p>
<p>The gentleman who had replied to me before looked round with a
smile of contemptuous wonder.</p>
<p>"Why, Monsieur de Caylus, of course," said he. "Did you not see
him play the king?"</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon," I said, somewhat nettled; "but, as I said
before, I do not understand the game."</p>
<p>"<i>Eh bien</i>! the Englishman is counting out his money."</p>
<p>What a changed scene it was! The circle of intent faces broken
and shifting--the silence succeeded by a hundred conversations--De
Caylus leaning back, sipping his wine and chatting over his
shoulder--the cards pushed aside, and Dalrymple gravely sorting out
little shining columns of Napoleons, and rolls of crisp bank paper!
Having ranged all these before him in a row, he took out his
check-book, filled in a page, tore it out and laid it with the
rest. Then, replacing the book in his breast-pocket, he pushed back
his chair, and, looking up for the first time since the close of
the game, said aloud:--</p>
<p>"Monsieur le Vicomte de Caylus, I have this evening had the
honor of losing the sum of twelve thousand francs to you; will you
do me the favor to count this money?"</p>
<p>M. de Caylus bowed, emptied his glass, and languidly touching
each little column with one dainty finger, told over his winnings
as though they were scarcely worth even that amount of trouble.</p>
<p>"Six rouleaux of four hundred each," said he, "making two
thousand four hundred--six notes of five hundred each, making three
thousand--and an order upon Rothschild for six thousand six
hundred; in all, twelve thousand. Thanks, Monsieur ... Monsieur ...
forgive me for not remembering your name."</p>
<p>Dalrymple looked up with a dangerous light in his eyes, and took
no notice of the apology.</p>
<p>"It appears to me, Monsieur le Vicomte Caylus," said he, giving
the other his full title and speaking with singular distinctness,
"that you hold the king very often at
<i>&eacute;cart&eacute;</i>."</p>
<p>De Caylus looked up with every vein on his forehead suddenly
swollen and throbbing.</p>
<p>"Monsieur!" he exclaimed, hoarsely.</p>
<p>"Especially when you deal," added Dalrymple, smoothing his
moustache with utter <i>sang-froid</i>, and keeping his eyes still
riveted upon his adversary.</p>
<p>With an inarticulate cry like the cry of a wild beast, De Caylus
sprung at him, foaming with rage, and was instantly flung back
against the wall, dragging with him not only the table-cloth, but
all the wine, money, and cards upon it.</p>
<p>"I will have blood for this!" he shrieked, struggling with those
who rushed in between. "I will have blood! Blood! Blood!"</p>
<p>Stained and streaming with red wine, he looked, in his ghastly
rage, as if he was already bathed in the blood he thirsted for.</p>
<p>Dalrymple drew himself to his full height, and stood looking on
with folded arms and a cold smile.</p>
<p>"I am quite ready," he said, "to give Monsieur le Vicomte full
satisfaction."</p>
<p>The room was by this time crowded to suffocation. I forced my
way through, and laid my hand on Dalrymple's arm.</p>
<p>"You have provoked this quarrel," I said, reproachfully.</p>
<p>"That, my dear fellow, is precisely what I came here to do," he
replied. "You will have to be my second in this affair."</p>
<p>Here De Simoncourt came up, and hearing the last words, drew me
aside.</p>
<p>"I act for De Caylus," he whispered. "Pistols, of course?"</p>
<p>I nodded, still all bewilderment at my novel position.</p>
<p>"Your man received the first blow, so is entitled to the first
shot."</p>
<p>I nodded again.</p>
<p>"I don't know a better place," he went on, "than Bellevue.
There's a famous little bit of plantation, and it is just far
enough from Paris to be secure. The Bois is hackneyed, and the
police are too much about it.</p>
<p>"Just so," I replied, vaguely.</p>
<p>"And when shall we say? The sooner the better, it always seems
to me, in these cases."</p>
<p>"Oh, certainly--the sooner the better."</p>
<p>He looked at his watch.</p>
<p>"It is now ten minutes to five," he said. "Suppose we allow them
five hours to put their papers in order, and meet at Bellevue, on
the terrace, at ten?"</p>
<p>"So soon!" I exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Soon!" echoed De Simoncourt. "Why, under circumstances of such
exceeding aggravation, most men would send for pistols and settle
it across the table!"</p>
<p>I shuddered. These niceties of honor were new to me, and I had
been brought up to make little distinction between duelling and
murder.</p>
<p>"Be it so, then, Monsieur De Simoncourt," I said. "We will meet
you at Bellevue, at ten."</p>
<p>"On the terrace?"</p>
<p>"On the terrace."</p>
<p>We bowed and parted. Dalrymple was already gone, and De Caylus,
still white and trembling with rage, was wiping the wine from his
face and shirt. The crowd opened for me right and left as I went
through the <i>salon</i>, and more than one voice whispered:--</p>
<p>"He is the Englishman's second."</p>
<p>I took my hat and cloak mechanically, and let myself out. It was
broad daylight, and the blinding sun poured full upon my eyes as I
passed into the street.</p>
<p>"Come, Damon," said Dalrymple, crossing over to me from the
opposite side of the way. "I have just caught a cab--there it is,
waiting round the corner! We've no time to lose, I'll be
bound."</p>
<p>"We are to meet them at Bellevue at ten," I replied.</p>
<p>"At ten? Hurrah! then I've still five certain hours of life
before me! Long enough, Damon, to do a world of mischief, if one
were so disposed!"</p>

<h3>THE DUEL AT BELLEVUE.</h3>
<br>
<p>We drove straight to Dalrymple's rooms, and, going in with a
pass-key, went up without disturbing the <i>concierge</i>. Arrived
at home, my friend's first act was to open his buffetier and take
out a loaf, a <i>pat&eacute; de foie gras</i>, and a bottle of
wine. I could not eat a morsel; but he supped (or breakfasted) with
a capital appetite; insisted that I should lie down on his bed for
two or three hours; and slipping into his dressing-gown, took out
his desk and cash-box, and settled himself to a regular morning's
work.</p>
<p>"I hope to get a nap myself before starting," said he. "I have
not many debts, and I made my will the day after I married--so I
have but little to transact in the way of business. A few letters
to write--a few to burn--a trifle or two to seal up and direct to
one or two fellows who may like a <i>souven&iacute;r</i>,--that is
the extent of my task! Meanwhile, my dear boy, get what rest you
can. It will never do to be shaky and pale on the field, you
know."</p>
<p>I went, believing that I should be less in his way; and, lying
down in my clothes, fell into a heavy sleep, from which, after what
seemed a long time, I woke suddenly with the conviction that it was
just ten o'clock. To start up, look at my watch, find that it was
only a quarter to seven and fall profoundly asleep again, was the
work of only a few minutes. At the end of another half-hour I woke
with the same dread, and with the same result; and so on twice or
thrice after, till at a quarter to nine I jumped up, plunged my
head into a basin of cold water, and went back to the
sitting-room.</p>
<p>I found him lying forward upon the table, fast asleep, with his
head resting on his hands. Some half-dozen letters lay folded and
addressed beside him--one directed to his wife. A little pile of
burnt paper fluttered on the hearth. His pistols were lying close
by in their mahogany case, the blue and white steel relieved
against the crimson-velvet lining. He slept so soundly, poor
fellow, that I could with difficulty make up my mind to wake him.
Once roused, however, he was alert and ready in a moment, changed
his coat, took out a new pair of lavender gloves, hailed a cab from
the window, and bade the driver name his own fare if he got us to
the terrace at Bellevue by five minutes before ten.</p>
<p>"I always like to be before my time in a matter of this kind,
Damon," said he. "It's shabby to be merely punctual when one has,
perhaps, not more than a quarter of an hour to live. By-the-by,
here are my keys. Take them, in case of accident. You will find a
copy of my will in my desk---the original is with my lawyer. The
letters you will forward, according to the addresses; and in my
cash-box you will find a paper directed to yourself."</p>
<p>I bent my head. I would not trust myself to speak. "As for the
letter to H&eacute;l&egrave;ne--to my wife," he said, turning his
face away, "will you--will you deliver that with your own
hands?"</p>
<p>"I will."</p>
<p>"I--I have had but little time to write it," he faltered, "and I
trust to you to supply the details. Tell her how I made the
quarrel, and how it ended. No one suspects it to be other than a
<i>fracas</i> over a game at <i>&eacute;cart&eacute;</i>. No one
supposes that I had any other motive, or any deeper vengeance--not
even De Caylus! I have not compromised her by word or deed. If I
shoot him, I free her without a breath of scandal. If I fall--"</p>
<p>His voice failed, and we were both silent for some moments</p>
<p>We were now past the Barrier, and speeding on rapidly towards
the open country. High white houses with jalousies closed against
the sun, and pretty maisonnettes in formal gardens, succeeded the
streets and shops of suburban Paris. Then came a long country road
bordered by poplars--by-and-by, glimpses of the Seine, and
scattered farms and villages far away--then S&egrave;vres and the
leafy heights of Bellevue overhanging the river.</p>
<p>We crossed the bridge, and the driver, mindful of his fare,
urged on his tired horse. Some country folks met us presently, and
a wagoner with a load of fresh hay. They all smiled and gave us
"good-day" as we passed--they going to their work in the fields,
and we to our work of bloodshed!</p>
<p>Shortly after this, the road began winding upwards, past the
porcelain factories and through the village of S&egrave;vres; after
which, having but a short distance of very steep road to climb, we
desired the cabman to wait, and went up on foot. Arrived at the
top, where a peep of blue daylight came streaming down upon us
through a green tunnel of acacias, we emerged all at once upon the
terrace, and found ourselves first on the field. Behind us rose a
hillside of woods--before us, glassy and glittering, as if traced
upon the transparent air, lay the city of palaces. Domes and
spires, arches and columns of triumph, softened by distance, looked
as if built of the sunshine. Far away on one side stretched the
Bois de Boulogne, undulating like a sea of tender green. Still
farther away on the other, lay P&egrave;re-la-Chaise--a dark hill
specked with white; cypresses and tombs. At our feet, winding round
a "lawny islet" and through a valley luxuriant in corn-fields and
meadows, flowed the broad river, bluer than the sky.</p>
<p>"A fine sight, Damon!" said Dalrymple, leaning on the parapet,
and coolly lighting a cigar. "If my eyes are never to open on the
day again, I am glad they should have rested for the last time on a
scene of so much beauty! Where is the painter who could paint it?
Not Claude himself, though he should come back to life on purpose,
and mix his colors with liquid sunlight!"</p>
<p>"You are a queer fellow," said I, "to talk of scenery and
painters at such a moment!"</p>
<p>"Not at all. Things are precious according to the tenure by
which we hold them. For my part, I do not know when I appreciated
earth and sky so heartily as this morning. <i>Tiens!</i> here comes
a carriage--our men, no doubt."</p>
<p>"Are you a good shot?" I asked anxiously.</p>
<p>"Pretty well. I can write my initials in bullet-holes on a sheet
of notepaper at forty paces, or toss up half-a-crown as I ride at
full gallop, and let the daylight through it as it comes down."</p>
<p>"Thank Heaven!"</p>
<p>"Not so fast, my boy. De Caylus is just as fine a shot, and one
of the most skilful swordsmen in the French service."</p>
<p>"Ay, but the first fire is yours!"</p>
<p>"Is it? Well, I suppose it is. He struck the first blow, and
so--here they come."</p>
<p>"One more word, Dalrymple--did he really cheat you at
<i>&eacute;cart&eacute;?</i>"</p>
<p>"Upon my soul, I don't know. He did hold the king very often,
and there are some queer stories told of him in Vienna by the
officers of the Emperor's Guard. At all events, this is not the
first duel he has had to fight in defence of his good-fortune!"</p>
<p>De Simoncourt now coming forward, we adjourned at once to the
wood behind the village. A little open glade was soon found; the
ground was soon measured; the pistols were soon loaded. De Caylus
looked horribly pale, but it was the pallor of concentrated rage,
with nothing of the craven hue in it. Dalrymple, on the contrary,
had neither more nor less color than usual, and puffed away at his
cigar with as much indifference as if he were waiting his turn at
the pit of the Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise. Both were clothed
in black from head to foot, with their coats buttoned to the
chin.</p>
<p>"All is ready," said De Simoncourt. "Gentlemen, choose your
weapons."</p>
<p>De Caylus took his pistols one by one, weighed and poised them,
examined the priming, and finally, after much hesitation,
decided.</p>
<p>Dalrymple took the first that came to hand.</p>
<p>The combatants then took their places--De Caylus with his hat
pulled low over his eyes; Dalrymple still smoking carelessly.</p>
<p>They exchanged bows.</p>
<p>"Major Dalrymple," said De Simoncourt, "it is for you to fire
first."</p>
<p>"God bless you, Damon!" said my friend, shaking me warmly by the
hand.</p>
<p>He then half turned aside, flung away the end of his cigar,
lifted his right arm suddenly, and fired.</p>
<p>I heard the dull thud of the ball--I saw De Caylus fling up his
arms and fall forward on the grass. I saw Dalrymple running to his
assistance. The next instant, however, the wounded man was on his
knees, ghastly and bleeding, and crying for his pistol.</p>
<p>"Give it me!" he gasped--"hold me up! I--I will have his life
yet! So, steady--steady!"</p>
<p>Shuddering, but not for his own danger, Dalrymple stepped calmly
back to his place; while De Caylus, supported by his second,
struggled to his feet and grasped his weapon. For a moment he once
more stood upright. His eye burned; his lips contracted; he seemed
to gather up all his strength for one last effort. Slowly,
steadily, surely, he raised his pistol--then swaying heavily back,
fired, and fell again.</p>
<p>"Dead this time, sure enough," said De Simoncourt, bending over
him.</p>
<p>"Indeed, I fear so," replied Dalrymple, in a low, grave voice.
"Can we do nothing to help you, Monsieur de Simoncourt?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, thank you. I have a carriage down the road, and must
get further assistance from the village. You had better lose no
time in leaving Paris."</p>
<p>"I suppose not. Good-morning."</p>
<p>"Good-morning,"</p>
<p>So we lifted our hats; gathered up the pistols; hurried out of
the wood and across a field, so avoiding the village; found our cab
waiting where we had left it; and in less than five minutes, were
rattling down the dusty hill again and hurrying towards Paris.</p>
<p>Once in the cab, Dalrymple began hastily pulling off his coat
and waistcoat. I was startled to see his shirt-front stained with
blood.</p>
<p>"Heavens!" I exclaimed, "you are not wounded?"</p>
<p>"Very slightly. De Caylus was too good a shot to miss me
altogether. Pshaw! 'tis nothing--a mere graze--not even the bullet
left in it!"</p>
<p>"If it had been a little more to the left...." I faltered.</p>
<p>"If he had fired one second sooner, or lived one second longer,
he would have had me through the heart, as sure as there's a heaven
above us!" said Dalrymple.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly changing his tone, he added, laughingly--</p>
<p>"Nonsense, Damon! cheer up, and help me to tear this
handkerchief into bandages. Now's the time to show off your

<h3>THE PORTRAIT.</h3>
<br>
<p>Having seen Dalrymple to his lodgings and dressed his wound,
which was, in truth, but a very slight one, I left him and went
home, promising to return in a few hours, and help him with his
packing; for we both agreed that he must leave Paris that evening,
come what might.</p>
<p>It was now close upon two o'clock, and I had been out since
between three and four the previous afternoon--not quite
twenty-four hours, in point of actual time; but a week, a month, a
year, in point of sensation! Had I not seen a man die since that
hour yesterday?</p>
<p>Walking homewards through the garish streets in the hot
afternoon, all the strange scenes in which I had just been an actor
thronged fantastically upon my memory. The joyous dinner with Franz
M&uuml;ller; the busy Temple; the noisy theatre; the long chase
through the wet streets at midnight; the crowded gaming-house; the
sweet country drive at early morning; the quiet wood, and the dead
man lying on his back, with the shadows of the leaves upon his
face,--all this, in strange distinctness, came between me and the
living tide of the Boulevards.</p>
<p>And now, over-tired and over-excited as I was, I remembered for
the first time that I had eaten nothing since half-past five that
morning. And then I also remembered that I had left M&uuml;ller
waiting for me under the archway, without a word of explanation. I
promised myself that I would write to him as soon as I got home,
and in the meantime turned in at the first Caf&eacute; to which I
came and called for breakfast. But when the breakfast was brought,
I could not eat it. The coffee tasted bitter to me. The meat stuck
in my throat. I wanted rest more than food--rest of body and mind,
and the forgetfulness of sleep! So I paid my bill, and, leaving the
untasted meal, went home like a man in a dream.</p>
<p>Madame Bou&iuml;sse was not in her little lodge as I passed
it--neither was my key on its accustomed hook. I concluded that she
was cleaning my rooms, and so, going upstairs, found my door open.
Hearing my own name, however, I paused involuntarily upon the
threshold.</p>
<p>"And so, as I was saying," pursued a husky voice, which I knew
at once to be the property of Madame Bou&iuml;sse, "M'sieur Basil's
friend painted it on purpose for him; and I am sure if he was as
good a Catholic as the Holy Father himself, and that picture was a
true portrait of our Blessed Lady, he could not worship it more
devoutly. I believe he says his prayers to it, mam'selle! I often
find it in the morning stuck up by the foot of his bed; and when he
comes home of an evening to study his books and papers, it always
stands on a chair just in front of his table, so that he can see it
without turning his head, every time he lifts his eyes from the
writing!"</p>
<p>In the murmured reply that followed, almost inaudible though it
was, my ear distinguished a tone that set my heart beating.</p>
<p>"Well, I can't tell, of course," said Madame Bou&iuml;sse, in
answer, evidently, to the remark just made; "but if mam'selle will
only take the trouble to look in the glass, and then look at the
picture, she will see how like it is. For my part, I believe it to
be that, and nothing else. Do you suppose I don't know the
symptoms? <i>Dame!</i> I have eyes, as well as my neighbors; and
you may take my word for it, mam'selle, that poor young gentleman
is just as much in love as ever a man was in this world!"</p>
<p>"No more of this, if you please, Madame Bou&iuml;sse," said
Hortense, so distinctly that I could no longer be in doubt as to
the speaker.</p>
<p>I stayed to hear no more; but retreating softly down the first
flight of stairs, came noisily up again, and went straight into my
rooms, saying:--</p>
<p>"Madame Bou&iuml;sse, are you here?"</p>
<p>"Not only Madame Bou&iuml;sse, but an intruder who implores
forgiveness," said Hortense, with a frank smile, but a heightened
color.</p>
<p>I bowed profoundly. No need to tell her she was welcome--my face
spoke for me.</p>
<p>"It was Madame Bou&iuml;sse who lured me in," continued she, "to
look at that painting."</p>
<p>"<i>Mais, oui!</i> I told mam'selle you had her portrait in your
sitting-room," laughed the fat <i>concierge,</i> leaning on her
broom. "I'm sure it's quite like enough to be hers, bless her sweet
face!"</p>
<p>I felt myself turn scarlet. To hide my confusion I took the
picture down, and carried it to the window.</p>
<p>"You will see it better by this light," I said, pretending to
dust it with my handkerchief. "It is worth a close
examination."</p>
<p>Hortense knelt down, and studied it for some moments in
silence.</p>
<p>"It must be a copy," she said, presently, more to herself than
me--"it must be a copy."</p>
<p>"It <i>is</i> a copy," I replied. "The original is at the
Ch&acirc;teau de Sainte Aulaire, near Montlh&eacute;ry."</p>
<p>"May I ask how you came by it?"</p>
<p>"A friend of mine, who is an artist, copied it."</p>
<p>"Then it was done especially for you?"</p>
<p>"Just so."</p>
<p>"And, no doubt, you value it?"</p>
<p>"More than anything I possess!"</p>
<p>Then, fearing I had said too much, I added:--</p>
<p>"If I had not admired the original very much, I should not have
wished for a copy."</p>
<p>She shifted the position of the picture in such a manner that,
standing where I did, I could no longer see her face.</p>
<p>"Then you have seen the original," she said, in a low tone.</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly--and you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I have seen it; but not lately."</p>
<p>There was a brief pause.</p>
<p>"Madame Bou&iuml;sse thinks it so like yourself, mademoiselle,"
I said, timidly, "that it might almost be your portrait."</p>
<p>"I can believe it," she answered. "It is very like my
mother."</p>
<p>Her voice faltered; and, still kneeling, she dropped her face in
her hands, and wept silently.</p>
<p>Madame Bou&iuml;sse, in the meantime, had gone into my
bedchamber, where she was sweeping and singing to herself with the
door three parts closed, believing, no doubt, that she was
affording me the opportunity to make a formal declaration.</p>
<p>"Alas! mademoiselle," I said, hesitatingly, "I little
thought..."</p>
<p>She rose, dashed the tears aside, and, holding out her hand to
me, said, kindly--</p>
<p>"It is no fault of yours, fellow-student, if I remind you of the
portrait, or if the portrait reminds me of one whom it resembles
still more nearly. I am sorry to have troubled your kind heart with
my griefs. It is not often that they rise to the surface."</p>
<p>I raised her hand reverently to my lips.</p>
<p>"But you are looking worn and ill yourself," she added. "Is
anything the matter?"</p>
<p>"Not now," I replied. "But I have been up all night, and--and I
am very tired."</p>
<p>"Was this in your professional capacity?"</p>
<p>"Not exactly--and yet partly so. I have been more a looker-on
than an active agent--and I have witnessed a frightful
death-scene."</p>
<p>She sighed, and shook her head.</p>
<p>"You are not of the stuff that surgeons are made of,
fellow-student," she said, kindly. "Instead of prescribing for
others, you need some one to prescribe for you. Why, your hand is
quite feverish. You should go to bed, and keep quiet for the next
twelve hours."</p>
<p>"I will lie down for a couple of hours when Madame Bou&iuml;sse
is gone; but I must be up and out again at six."</p>
<p>"Nay, that is in three hours."</p>
<p>"I cannot help it. It is my duty."</p>
<p>"Then I have no more to say. Would you drink some lemonade, if I
made it for you?"</p>
<p>"I would drink poison, if you made it for me!"</p>
<p>"A decidedly misplaced enthusiasm!" laughed she, and left the
room.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LII."></a>CHAPTER LII.</h2>
<h3>NEWS FROM ENGLAND.</h3>
<br>
<p>It was a glorious morning--first morning of the first week in
the merry month of June--as I took my customary way to Dr.
Ch&eacute;ron's house in the Faubourg St. Germain. I had seen
Dalrymple off by the night train the evening previous, and,
refreshed by a good night's rest, had started somewhat earlier than
usual, for the purpose of taking a turn in the Luxembourg Gardens
before beginning my day's work.</p>
<p>There the blossoming parterres, the lavish perfume from
geranium-bed and acacia-blossom, and the mad singing of the little
birds up among the boughs, set me longing for a holiday. I thought
of Saxonholme, and the sweet English woodlands round about. I
thought how pleasant it would be to go home to dear Old England, if
only for ten days, and surprise my father in his quiet study. What
if I asked Dr. Ch&eacute;ron to spare me for a fortnight?</p>
<p>Turning these things over in my mind, I left the gardens, and,
arriving presently at the well-known Porte Coch&egrave;re in the
Rue de Mont Parnasse, rang the great bell, crossed the dull
courtyard, and took my usual seat at my usual desk, not nearly so
well disposed for work as usual.</p>
<p>"If you please, Monsieur," said the solemn servant, making his
appearance at the door, "Monsieur le Docteur requests your presence
in his private room."</p>
<p>I went. Dr. Ch&eacute;ron was standing on the hearth-rug, with
his back to the fire, and his arms folded over his breast. An open
letter, bordered broadly with black, lay upon his desk. Although
distant some two yards from the table, his eyes were fixed upon
this paper. When I came in he looked up, pointed to a seat, but
himself remained standing and silent.</p>
<p>"Basil Arbuthnot," he said, after a pause of some minutes, "I
have this morning received a letter from England, by the early
post."</p>
<p>"From my father, sir?"</p>
<p>"No. From a stranger,"</p>
<p>He looked straight at me as he said this, and hesitated.</p>
<p>"But it contains news," he added, "that--that much concerns
you."</p>
<p>There was a fixed gravity about the lines of his handsome mouth,
and an unwonted embarrassment in his manner, that struck me with
apprehension.</p>
<p>"Good news, I--I hope, sir," I faltered.</p>
<p>"Bad news, my young friend," said he, compassionately. "News
that you must meet like a man, with fortitude--with resignation.
Your father--your excellent father--my honored friend--"</p>
<p>He pointed to the letter and turned away.</p>
<p>I rose up, sat down, rose up again, reached out a trembling hand
for the letter, and read the loss that my heart had already
presaged.</p>
<p>My father was dead.</p>
<p>Well as ever in the morning, he had been struck with apoplexy in
the afternoon, and died in a few hours, apparently without
pain.</p>
<p>The letter was written by our old family lawyer, and concluded
with the request that Dr. Ch&eacute;ron would "break the melancholy
news to Mr. Basil Arbuthnot, who would doubtless return to England
for the funeral."</p>
<p>My tears fell one by one upon the open letter. I had loved my
father tenderly in my heart. His very roughnesses and
eccentricities were dear to me. I could not believe that he was
gone. I could not believe that I should never hear his voice
again!</p>
<p>Dr. Ch&eacute;ron came over, and laid his hand upon my
shoulder.</p>
<p>"Come," he said, "you have much to do, and must soon be on your
way. The express leaves at midday. It is now ten, you have only two
hours left."</p>
<p>"My poor father!"</p>
<p>"Brunet," continued the Doctor, "shall go back with you to your
lodgings and help you to pack. As for money--"</p>
<p>He took out his pocket-book and offered me a couple of notes;
but I shook my head and put them from me.</p>
<p>"I have enough money, thank you," I said. "Good-bye."</p>
<p>"Good-bye," he replied, and, for the first time in all these
months, shook me by the hand. "You will write to me?"</p>
<p>I bowed my head in silence, and we parted. I found a cab at the
door, and Brunet on the box. I was soon at home again. Home! I felt
as if I had no home now, either in France or England--as if all my
Paris life were a brief, bright dream, and this the dreary waking.
Hortense was out. It was one of her busy mornings, and she would
not be back till the afternoon. It was very bitter to leave without
one last look--one last word. I seized pen and paper, and yielding
for the first time to all the impulses of my love, wrote, without
weighing my words, these few brief sentences:--</p>
<p>"I have had a heavy loss, Hortense, and by the time you open
this letter I shall be far away. My father--my dear, good
father--is no more. My mother died when I was a little child. I
have no brothers--no sisters--no close family ties. I am alone in
the world now--quite alone. My last thought here is of you. If it
seems strange to speak of love at such a moment, forgive me, for
that love is now my only hope. Oh, that you were here, that I might
kiss your hand at parting, and know that some of your thoughts went
with me! I cannot believe that you are quite indifferent to me. It
seems impossible that, loving you as I love, so deeply, so
earnestly, I should love in vain. When I come back I shall seek you
here, where I have loved you so long. I shall look into your eyes
for my answer, and read in them all the joy, or all the despair, of
the life that lies before me. I had intended to get that portrait
copied again for you, because you saw in it some likeness to your
mother; but there has been no time, and ere you receive this letter
I shall be gone. I therefore send the picture to you by the
<i>concierge</i>. It is my parting gift to you. I can offer no
greater proof of my love. Farewell."</p>
<p>Once written, I dared not read the letter over. I thrust it
under her door, and in less than five minutes was on my way to the
station.</p>

<h3>THE FADING OF THE RAINBOW.</h3>
<center>I loved a love once, fairest among women;<br>
Closed are her doors on me, I must not see her--<br>
All, all are gone, the old familiar faces.<br>
<br>
LAMB.</center>
<br>
<p>Beautifully and truly, in the fourth book of the most poetical
of stories, has a New World romancist described the state of a
sorrowing lover. "All around him," saith he, "seemed dreamy and
vague; all within him, as in a sun's eclipse. As the moon, whether
visible or invisible, has power over the tides of the ocean, so the
face of that lady, whether present or absent, had power over the
tides of his soul, both by day and night, both waking and sleeping.
In every pale face and dark eye he saw a resemblance to her; and
what the day denied him in reality, the night gave him in
dreams."</p>
<p>Such was, very faithfully, my own condition of mind during the
interval which succeeded my departure from Paris--the only
difference being that Longfellow's hero was rejected by the woman
he loved, and sorrowing for that rejection; whilst I, neither
rejected nor accepted, mourned another grief, and through the tears
of that trouble, looked forward anxiously to my uncertain
future.</p>
<p>I reached Saxonholme the night before my father's funeral, and
remained there for ten days. I found myself, to my surprise, almost
a rich man--that is to say, sufficiently independent to follow the
bent of my inclinations as regarded the future.</p>
<p>My first impulse, on learning the extent of my means, was to
relinquish a career that had been from the first distasteful to
me--my second was to leave the decision to Hortense. To please her,
to be worthy of her, to prove my devotion to her, was what I most
desired upon earth. If she wished to see me useful and active in my
generation, I would do my best to be so for her sake--if, on the
contrary, she only cared to see me content, I would devote myself
henceforth to that life of "retired leisure" that I had always
coveted. Could man love more honestly and heartily?</p>
<p>One year of foreign life had wrought a marked difference in me.
I had not observed it so much in Paris; but here, amid old scenes
and old reminiscences, I seemed to meet the image of my former
self, and wondered at the change 'twixt now and then. I left home,
timid, ignorant of the world and its ways, reserved, silent, almost
misanthropic. I came back strengthened mentally and physically.
Studious as ever, I could yet contemplate an active career without
positive repugnance; I knew how to meet and treat my fellow-men; I
was acquainted with society in its most refined and most homely
phases. I had tasted of pleasure, of disappointment, of love--of
all that makes life earnest.</p>
<p>As the time drew near when I should return to Paris, grief, and
hope, and that strange reluctance which would fain defer the thing
it most desires, perplexed and troubled me by day and night. Once
again on the road, the past seemed more than ever dream-like, and
Paris and Saxonholme became confused together in my mind, like the
mingling outlines of two dissolving views.</p>
<p>I crossed the channel this time in a thick, misting rain; pushed
on straight for Paris, and reached the Cit&eacute; Berg&egrave;re
in the midst of a warm and glowing afternoon. The great streets
were crowded with carriages and foot-passengers. The trees were in
their fullest leaf. The sun poured down on pavement and awning with
almost tropical intensity. I dismissed my cab at the top of the Rue
du Faubourg Montmatre, and went up to the house on foot. A
flower-girl sat in the shade of the archway, tying up her flowers
for the evening-sale, and I bought a cluster of white roses for
Hortense as I went by.</p>
<p>Madame Bou&iuml;sse was sound asleep in her little sanctum; but
my key hung in its old place, so I took it without disturbing her,
and went up as if I had been away only a few hours. Arrived at the
third story, I stopped outside Hortense's door and listened. All
was very silent within. She was out, perhaps; or writing quietly in
the farther chamber. I thought I would leave my travelling-bag in
my own room, and then ring boldly for admittance. I turned the key,
and found myself once again in my own familiar, pleasant student
home. The books and busts were there in their accustomed places;
everything was as I had left it. Everything, except the picture!
The picture was gone; so Hortense had accepted it.</p>
<p>Three letters awaited me on the table; one from Dr.
Ch&eacute;ron, written in a bold hand--a mere note of condolence:
one from Dalrymple, dated Chamounix: the third from Hortense. I
knew it was from her. I knew that that small, clear, upright
writing, so singularly distinct and regular, could be only hers. I
had never seen it before; but my heart identified it.</p>
<p>That letter contained my fate. I took it up, laid it down, paced
backwards and forwards, and for several minutes dared not break the
seal. At length I opened it. It ran thus:--</p>
<p>"FRIEND AND FELLOW-STUDENT.</p>
<p>"I had hoped that a man such as you and a woman such as I might
become true friends, discuss books and projects, give and take the
lesser services of life, and yet not end by loving. In this belief,
despite occasional misgivings, I have suffered our intercourse to
become intimacy--our acquaintance, friendship. I see now that I was
mistaken, and now, when it is, alas! too late, I reproach myself
for the consequences of that mistake.</p>
<p>"I can be nothing to you, friend. I have duties in life more
sacred than marriage. I have a task to fulfil which is sterner than
love, and imperative as fate. I do not say that to answer you thus
costs me no pain. Were there even hope, I would bid you hope; but
my labor presses heavily upon me, and repeated failure has left me
weary and heart-sick.</p>
<p>"You tell me in your letter that, by the time I read it, you
will be far away. It is now my turn to repeat the same words. When
you come back to your rooms, mine will be empty. I shall be gone;
all I ask is, that you will not attempt to seek me.</p>
<p>"Farewell. I accept your gift. Perhaps I act selfishly in taking
it, but a day may come when I shall justify that selfishness to
you. In the meantime, once again farewell. You are my only friend,
and these are the saddest words I have ever written--forget me!</p>
<p>"HORTENSE."</p>
<p>I scarcely know how I felt, or what I did, on first reading this
letter. I believe that I stood for a long time stone still,
incapable of realizing the extent of my misfortune. By-and-by it
seemed to rush upon me suddenly. I threw open my window, scaled the
balcony rails, and forced my way into her rooms.</p>
<p>Her rooms! Ah, by that window she used to sit--at that table she
read and wrote--in that bed she slept! All around and about were
scattered evidences of her presence. Upon the chimney-piece lay an
envelope addressed to her name--upon the floor, some fragments of
torn paper and some ends of cordage! The very flowers were yet
fresh upon her balcony! The sight of these things, while they
confirmed my despair, thawed the ice at my heart. I kissed the
envelope that she had touched, the flowers she had tended, the
pillow on which her head had been wont to rest. I called wildly on
her name. I threw myself on the floor in my great agony, and wept
aloud.</p>
<p>I cannot tell how long I may have lain there; but it seemed like
a lifetime. Long enough, at all events, to drink the bitter draught
to the last drop--long enough to learn that life had now no grief
in store for which I should weep again.</p>

<h3>TREATETH OF MANY THINGS; BUT CHIEFLY OF BOOKS AND POETS.</h3>
<center>Dreams, books, are each a world; and books, we know,<br>
Are a substantial world, both pure and good.<br>
<br>
WORDSWORTH.</center>
<br>
<p>There are times when this beautiful world seems to put on a
mourning garb, as if sympathizing, like a gentle mother, with the
grief that consumes us; when the trees shake their arms in mute
sorrow, and scatter their faded leaves like ashes on our heads;
when the slow rains weep down upon us, and the very clouds look
cold above. Then, like Hamlet the Dane, we take no pleasure in the
life that weighs so wearily upon us, and deem "this goodly frame,
the earth, a sterile promonotory; this most excellent canopy, the
air, this brave, overhanging firmament, this majestical roof
fretted with golden fire, a foul and pestilent congregation of
vapors."</p>
<p>So it was with me, in the heavy time that followed my return to
Paris. I had lost everything in losing her I loved. I had no aim in
life. No occupation. No hope. No rest. The clouds had rolled
between me and the sun, and wrapped me in their cold shadows, and
all was dark about me. I felt that I could say with an old
writer--"For the world, I count it, not an inn, but an hospital;
and a place, not to live, but to die in."</p>
<p>Week after week I lingered in Paris, hoping against hope, and
always seeking her. I had a haunting conviction that she was not
far off, and that, if I only had strength to persevere, I must find
her. Possessed by this fixed idea, I paced the sultry streets day
after day throughout the burning months of June and July; lingered
at dusk and early morning about the gardens of the Luxembourg, and
such other quiet places as she might frequent; and, heedless alike
of fatigue, or heat, or tempest, traversed the dusty city over and
over again from barrier to barrier, in every direction.</p>
<p>Could I but see her once more--once only! Could I but listen to
her sweet voice, even though it bade me an eternal farewell! Could
I but lay my lips for the last, last time upon her hand, and see
the tender pity in her eyes, and be comforted!</p>
<p>Seeking, waiting, sorrowing thus, I grew daily weaker and paler,
scarcely conscious of my own failing strength, and indifferent to
all things save one. In vain Dr. Ch&eacute;ron urged me to resume
my studies. In vain M&uuml;ller, ever cheerful and active, came
continually to my lodgings, seeking to divert my thoughts into
healthier channels. In vain I received letter after letter from
Oscar Dalrymple, imploring me to follow him to Switzerland, where
his wife had already joined him. I shut my eyes to all alike. Study
had grown hateful to me; M&uuml;ller's cheerfulness jarred upon me;
Dalrymple was too happy for my companionship. Liberty to pursue my
weary search, peace to brood over my sorrow, were all that I now
asked. I had not yet arrived at that stage when sympathy grows
precious.</p>
<p>So weeks went by, and August came, and a slow conviction of the
utter hopelessness of my efforts dawned gradually upon me. She was
really gone. If she had been in Paris all this time pursuing her
daily avocations, I must surely have found her. Where should I seek
her next? What should I do with life, with time, with the
future?</p>
<p>I resolved, at all events, to relinquish medicine at once, and
for ever. So I wrote a brief farewell to Dr. Ch&eacute;ron and
another to M&uuml;ller, and without seeing either again, returned
abruptly to England.</p>
<p>I will not dwell on this part of my story; enough that I settled
my affairs as quickly as might be, left an old servant in care of
the solitary house that had been my birthplace, and turned my back
once more on Saxonholme, perhaps for years--perhaps for ever; and
in less than three weeks was again on my way to the Continent.</p>
<p>The spirit of restlessness was now upon me. I had no home; I had
no peace; and in place of the sun there was darkness. So I went
with the thorns around my brow, and the shadow of the cross upon my
breast. I went to suffer--to endure,--if possible, to forget. Oh,
the grief of the soul which lives on in the night, and looks for no
dawning! Oh, the weary weight that presses down the tired eyelids,
and yet leaves them sleepless! Oh, the tide of alien faces, and the
sickening remembrance of one, too dear, which may never be looked
upon again! I carried with me the antidote to every pleasure. In
the midst of crowds, I was alone. In the midst of novelty, the one
thought came, and made all stale to me. Like Dr. Donne, I dwelt
with the image of my dead self at my side.</p>
<p>Thus for many, many months we journeyed together---I and my
sorrow--and passed through fair and famous places, and saw the
seasons change under new skies. To the quaint old Flemish cities
and the Gothic Rhine--to the plains and passes of Spain--to the
unfrequented valleys of the Tyrol and the glacier-lands of
Switzerland I went, but still found not the forgetfulness I sought.
As in Holbein's fresco the skeleton plays his part in every scene,
so my trouble stalked beside me, drank of my cup, and sat grimly at
my table. It was with me in Naples and among the orange groves of
Sorrento. It met me amid the ruins of the Roman Forum. It travelled
with me over the blue Mediterranean, and landed beside me on the
shores of the Cyclades. Go where I would, it possessed and followed
me, and brooded over my head, like the cloud that rested on the
ark.</p>
<p>Thinking over this period of my life, I seem to be turning the
leaves of a rich album, or wandering through a gallery of glowing
landscapes, and yet all the time to be dreaming. Faces grown
familiar for a few days and never seen after--pictures photographed
upon the memory in all their vividness--glimpses of cathedrals, of
palaces, of ruins, of sunset and storm, sea and shore, flit before
me for a moment, and are gone like phantasmagoria.</p>
<p>And like phantasmagoria they impressed me at the time. Nothing
seemed real to me. Startled, now and then, into admiration or
wonder, my apathy fell from me like a garment, and my heart
throbbed again as of old. But this was seldom--so seldom that I
could almost count the times when it befell me.</p>
<p>Thus it was that travelling did me no permanent good. It
enlarged my experience; it undoubtedly cultivated my taste; but it
brought me neither rest, nor sympathy, nor consolation. On the
contrary, it widened the gulf between me and my fellow-men. I
formed no friendships. I kept up no correspondence. A sojourner in
hotels, I became more and more withdrawn from all tender and social
impulses, and almost forgot the very name of home. So strong a hold
did this morbid love of self-isolation take upon me, that I left
Florence on one occasion, after a stay of only three days, because
I had seen the names of a Saxonholme family among the list of
arrivals in the Giornale Toscano.</p>
<p>Three years went by thus--three springs--three vintages--three
winters--till, weary of wandering, I began to ask myself "what
next?" My old passion for books had, in the meantime, re-asserted
itself, and I longed once more for quiet. I knew not that my
pilgrimage was hopeless. I know that I loved her ever; that I could
never forget her; that although the first pangs were past, I yet
must bear</p>
<blockquote>"All the aching of heart, the restless, unsatisfied
longing,<br>
All the dull, deep pain, and constant anguish of
patience!"</blockquote>
<p>I reasoned with myself. I resolved to be stronger--at all
events, to be calmer. Exhausted and world-worn, I turned in thought
to my native village among the green hills, to my deserted home,
and the great solitary study with its busts and bookshelves, and
its vista of neglected garden. The rooms where my mother died;
where my father wrote; where, as a boy, I dreamed and studied,
would at least have memories for me.</p>
<p>Perhaps, silently underlying all these motives, I may at this
time already have begun to entertain one other project which was
not so much a motive as a hope--not so much a hope as a half-seen
possibility. I had written verses from time to time all my life
long, and of late they had come to me more abundantly than ever.
They flowed in upon me at times like an irresistible tide; at
others they ebbed away for weeks, and seemed as if gone for ever.
It was a power over which I had no control, and sought to have
none. I never tried to make verses; but, when the inspiration was
upon me, I made them, as it were, in spite of myself. My desk was
full of them in time--sonnets, scraps of songs, fragments of blank
verse, attempts in all sorts of queer and rugged
metres--hexameters, pentameters, alcaics, and the like; with, here
and there, a dialogue out of an imaginary tragedy, or a translation
from some Italian or German poet. This taste grew by degrees, to be
a rare and subtle pleasure to me. My rhymes became my companions,
and when the interval of stagnation came, I was restless and lonely
till it passed away.</p>
<p>At length there came an hour (I was lying, I remember, on a
ledge of turf on a mountain-side, overlooking one of the Italian
valleys of the Alps), when I asked myself for the first time--</p>
<p>"Am I also a poet?"</p>
<p>I had never dreamed of it, never thought of it, never even hoped
it, till that moment. I had scribbled on, idly, carelessly, out of
what seemed a mere facile impulse, correcting nothing; seldom even
reading what I had written, after it was committed to paper. I had
sometimes been pleased with a melodious cadence or a happy
image--sometimes amused with my own flow of thought and readiness
of versification; but that I, simple Basil Arbuthnot, should be,
after all, enriched with this splendid gift of song--was it mad
presumption, or were these things proof? I knew not; but lying on
the parched grass of the mountain-side, I tried the question over
in my mind, this way and that, till "my heart beat in my brain,"
How should I come at the truth? How should I test whether this
opening Paradise was indeed Eden, or only the mirage of my
fancy--mere sunshine upon sand? We all write verses at some moment
or other in our lives, even the most prosaic amongst us--some
because they are happy; some because they are sad; some because the
living fire of youth impels them, and they must be up and doing,
let the work be what it may.</p>
<blockquote>"Many fervent souls,<br>
Strike rhyme on rhyme, who would strike steel on steel,<br>
If steel had offer'd."</blockquote>
<p>Was this case mine? Was I fancying myself a poet, only because I
was an idle man, and had lost the woman I loved? To answer these
questions myself was impossible. They could only be answered by the
public voice, and before I dared question that oracle I had much to
do. I resolved to discipline myself to the harness of rhythm. I
resolved to go back to the fathers of poetry--to graduate once
again in Homer and Dante, Chaucer and Shakespeare. I promised
myself that, before I tried my wings in the sun, I would be my own
severest critic. Nay, more--that I would never try them so long as
it seemed possible a fall might come of it. Once come to this
determination, I felt happier and more hopeful than I had felt for
the last three years. I looked across the blue mists of the valley
below, and up to the aerial peaks which rose, faint, and far, and
glittering--mountain beyond mountain, range above range, as if
painted on the thin, transparent air--and it seemed to me that they
stood by, steadfast and silent, the witnesses of my resolve.</p>
<p>"I will be strong," I said. "I will be an idler and a dreamer no
longer. Books have been my world. I have taken all, and given
nothing. Now I too will work, and work to prove that I was not
unworthy of her love."</p>
<p>Going down, by-and-by, into the valley as the shadows were
lengthening, I met a traveller with an open book in his hand. He
was an Englishman--small, sallow, wiry, and wore a gray, loose
coat, with two large pockets full of books. I had met him once
before at Milan, and again in a steamer on Lago Maggiore. He was
always reading. He read in the diligence--he read when he was
walking--he read all through dinner at the
<i>tables-d'-h&ocirc;te</i>. He had a mania for reading; and,
might, in fact, be said to be bound up in his own library.</p>
<p>Meeting thus on the mountain, we fell into conversation. He told
me that he was on his way to Geneva, that he detested continental
life, and that he was only waiting the arrival of certain letters
before starting for England.</p>
<p>"But," said I, "you do not, perhaps, give continental life a
trial. You are always absorbed in the pages of a book; and, as for
the scenery, you appear not to observe it."</p>
<p>"Deuce take the scenery!" he exclaimed, pettishly. "I never look
at it. All scenery's alike. Trees, mountains, water--water,
mountains, trees; the same thing over and over again, like the bits
of colored glass in a kaleidoscope. I read about the scenery, and
that is quite enough for me."</p>
<p>"But no book can paint an Italian lake or an Alpine sunset; and
when one is on the spot...."</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon," interrupted the traveller in gray.
"Everything is much pleasanter and more picturesque in books than
in reality--travelling especially. There are no bad smells in
books. There are no long bills in books. Above all, there are no
mosquitoes. Travelling is the greatest mistake in the world, and I
am going home as fast as I can."</p>
<p>"And henceforth, I suppose, your travels will be confined to
your library," I said, smiling.</p>
<p>"Exactly so. I may say, with Hazlitt, that 'food, warmth, sleep,
and a book,' are all I require. With those I may make the tour of
the world, and incur neither expense nor fatigue."</p>
<p>"Books, after all, are friends," I said, with a sigh.</p>
<p>"Sir," replied the traveller, waving his hand somewhat
theatrically, "books are our first real friends, and our last. I
have no others. I wish for no others. I rely upon no others. They
are the only associates upon whom a sensible man may depend. They
are always wise, and they are always witty. They never intrude upon
us when we desire to be alone. They never speak ill of us behind
our backs. They are never capricious, and never surly; neither are
they, like some clever folks, pertinaciously silent when we most
wish them to shine. Did Shakespeare ever refuse his best thoughts
to us, or Montaigne decline to be companionable? Did you ever find
Moli&egrave;re dull? or Lamb prosy? or Scott unentertaining?"</p>
<p>"You remind me," said I, laughing, "of the student in Chaucer,
who desired for his only pleasure and society,</p>
<blockquote>"'---at his bedde's head<br>
A'twenty bokes clothed in black and red,<br>
Of Aristotle and his philosophy!'"</blockquote>
<p>"Ay," replied my new acquaintance, "but he preferred them
expressly to 'robes riche, or fidel or sautrie,' whereas, I prefer
them to men and women, and to Aristotle and his philosophy, into
the bargain!"</p>
<p>"Your own philosophy, at least, is admirable," said I. "For many
a year--I might almost say for most years of my life--I have been a
disciple in the same school."</p>
<p>"Sir, you cannot belong to a better. Think of the convenience of
always carrying half a dozen intimate friends in your pocket!
Good-afternoon."</p>
<p>We had now come to a point where two paths diverged, and the
reading traveller, always economical of time, opened his book where
he had last turned down the leaf, and disappeared round the
corner.</p>
<p>I never saw him again; but his theory amused me, and, as trifles
will sometimes do even in the gravest matters, decided me. So the
result of all my hopes and reflections was, that I went back to
England and to the student life that had been the dream of my
youth.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LV."></a>CHAPTER LV.</h2>
<h3>MY BIRTHDAY.</h3>
<br>
<p>Three years of foreign travel, and five of retirement at home,
brought my twenty-ninth birthday. I was still young, it is true;
but how changed from that prime of early manhood when I used to
play Romeo at midnight to Hortense upon her balcony! I looked at
myself in the glass that morning, and contemplated the wearied,
bronzed, and bearded face which</p>
<p>"...seared by toil and something touched by time,"</p>
<p>now gave me back glance for glance. I looked older than my age
by many years. My eyes had grown grave with a steadfast melancholy,
and streaks of premature silver gleamed here and there in the still
abundant hair which had been the solitary vanity of my youth.</p>
<p>"Is she also thus changed and faded?" I asked myself, as I
turned away. And then I sighed to think that if we met she might
not know me.</p>
<p>For I loved her still; worshipped her; raised altars to her in
the dusky chambers of my memory. My whole life was dedicated to
her. My best thoughts were hers. My poems, my ambition, my hours of
labor, all were hers only! I knew now that no time could change the
love which had so changed me, or dim the sweet remembrance of that
face which I carried for ever at my heart like an amulet. Other
women might be fair, but my eyes never sought them; other voices
might be sweet, but my ear never listened to them; other hands
might be soft, but my lips never pressed them. She was the only
woman in all my world--the only star in all my night--the one Eve
of my ruined Paradise. In a word, I loved her--loved her, I think,
more dearly than before I lost her.</p>
<blockquote>"Love is not love<br>
Which alters when it alteration finds,<br>
Or bends with the remover to remove:<br>
O no! it is an ever-fixed mark,<br>
That looks on tempests and is never shaken."</blockquote>
<p>I had that morning received by post a parcel of London papers
and magazines, which, for a foolish reason of my own, I almost
dreaded to open; so, putting off the evil hour, I thrust the
ominous parcel into my pocket and went out to read it in some green
solitude, far away among the lonely hills and tracts of furzy
common that extend for miles and miles around my native place. It
was a delicious autumn morning, bright and fresh and joyous as
spring. The purple heather was all abloom along the slopes of the
hill-sides. The golden sandcliffs glittered in the sun. The great
firwoods reached away over heights and through valleys--"grand and
spiritual trees," pointing ever upward with warning finger, like
the Apostles in the old Italian pictures. Now I passed a solitary
farm-yard where busy laborers were piling the latest stacks; now
met a group of happy children gathering wild nuts and blackberries.
By-and-by, I came upon a great common, with a picturesque mill
standing high against the sky. All around and about stretched a
vast prospect of woodland and tufted heath, bounded far off by a
range of chalk-hills speckled with farm-houses and villages, and
melting towards the west into a distance faint and far, and mystic
as the horizon of a Turner.</p>
<p>Here I threw myself on the green turf and rested. Truly, Nature
is a great "physician of souls." The peace of the place descended
into my heart, and hushed for a while the voice of its repinings.
The delicious air, the living silence of the woods, the dreamy
influences of the autumnal sunshine, all alike served to lull me
into a pleasant mood, neither gay nor sad, but very calm--calm
enough for the purpose for which I had come. So I brought out my
packet of papers, summoned all my philosophy to my aid, and met my
own name upon the second page. For here was, as I had anticipated,
a critique on my first volume of poems.</p>
<p>Indifference to criticism, if based upon a simple consciousness
of moral right, is a noble thing. But indifference to criticism,
taken in its ordinary, and especially its literary sense, is
generally a very small thing, and resolves itself, for the most
part, into a halting and one-sided kind of stoicism, meaning
indifference to blame and ridicule, and never indifference to
praise. It is very convenient to the disappointed authorling; very
effective, in the established writer; but it is mere vanity at the
root, and equally contemptible in both. For my part, I confess that
I came to my trial as tremblingly as any poor caitiff to the fiery
ordeal, and finding myself miraculously clear of the burning
ploughshares, was quite as full of wonder and thankfulness at my
good fortune. For I found my purposes appreciated, and my best
thoughts understood; not, it is true, without some censure, but it
was censure tempered so largely with encouragement that I drew hope
from it, and not despondency. And then I thought of Hortense, and,
picturing to myself all the joy it would have been to lay these
things at her feet, I turned my face to the grass, and wept like a
child.</p>
<p>Then, one by one, the ghosts of my dead hopes rose out of the
grave of the past and vanished "into thin air" before me; and in
their place came earnest aspirations, born of the man's strong
will. I resolved to use wisely the gifts that were mine--to sing
well the song that had risen to my lips--to "seize the spirit of my
time," and turn to noble uses the God-given weapons of the poet. So
should I be worthier of her remembrance, if she yet remembered
me--worthier, at all events, to remember her.</p>
<p>Thus the hours ebbed, and when I at length rose and turned my
face homeward, the golden day was already bending westward. Lower
and lower sank the sun as the miles shortened; stiller and sweeter
grew the evening air; and ever my lengthening shadow travelled
before me along the dusty road--wherein I was more fortunate than
the man in the German story who sold his to the devil.</p>
<p>It was quite dusk by the time I gained the outskirts of the
town, and I reflected with much contentment upon the prospect of a
cosy bachelor dinner, and, after dinner, lamplight and a book.</p>
<p>"If you please, sir," said Collins, "a lady has been here."</p>
<p>Collins--the same Collins who had been my father's servant when
I was a boy at home--was now a grave married man, with hair fast
whitening.</p>
<p>"A lady?" I echoed. "One of my cousins, I suppose, from
Effingham."</p>
<p>"No, sir," said Collins. "A strange lady--a foreigner."</p>
<p>A stranger! a foreigner! I felt myself change color.</p>
<p>"She left her name?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Her card, sir," said Collins, and handed it to me.</p>
<p>I took it up with fingers that shook in spite of me and
read:--</p>
<p>MADLLE DE SAINTE AULAIRE.</p>
<p>I dropped the card, with a sigh of profound disappointment.</p>
<p>"At what time did this lady call, Collins?"</p>
<p>"Not very long after you left the house, sir. She said she would
call again. She is at the White Horse."</p>
<p>"She shall not have the trouble of coming here," I said, drawing
my chair to the table. "Send James up to the White Horse with my
compliments, and say that I will wait upon the lady in about an
hour's time."</p>
<p>Collins darted away to despatch the message, and returning
presently with the pale ale, uncorked it dexterously, and stood at
the side-board, serenely indifferent.</p>
<p>"And what kind of person was this--this Mademoiselle de Sainte
Aulaire, Collins?" I asked, leisurely bisecting a partridge.</p>
<p>"Can't say, sir, indeed. Lady kept her veil down."</p>
<p>"Humph! Tall or short, Collins?"</p>
<p>"Rather tall, sir."</p>
<p>"Young?"</p>
<p>"Haven't an idea, sir. Voice very pleasant, though."</p>
<p>A pleasant voice has always a certain attraction for me.
Hortense's voice was exquisite--rich and low, and somewhat deeper
than the voices of most women.</p>
<p>I took up the card again. Mademoiselle de Sainte Aulaire! Where
had I heard that name?</p>
<p>"She said nothing of the nature of her business, I suppose,
Collins?"</p>
<p>"Nothing at all, sir. Dear me, sir, I beg pardon for not
mentioning it before; but there's been a messenger over from the
White Horse, since the lady left, to know if you were yet
home."</p>
<p>"Then she is in haste?"</p>
<p>"Very uncommon haste, I should say, sir," replied Collins,
deliberately.</p>
<p>I pushed back the untasted dish, and rose directly.</p>
<p>"You should have told me this before," I said, hastily.</p>
<p>"But--but surely, sir, you will dine--"</p>
<p>"I will wait for nothing," I interrupted. "I'll go at once. Had
I known the lady's business was urgent, I would not have delayed a
moment."</p>
<p>Collins cast a mournful glance at the table, and sighed respect
fully. Before he had recovered from his amazement, I was half way
to the inn.</p>
<p>The White Horse was now the leading hostelry of Saxonholme. The
old Red Lion was no more. Its former host and hostess were dead; a
brewery occupied its site; and the White Horse was kept by a portly
Boniface, who had been head-waiter under the extinct dynasty. But
there had been many changes in Saxonholme since my boyish days, and
this was one of the least among them.</p>
<p>I was shown into the best sitting-room, preceded by a smart
waiter in a white neckcloth. At a glance I took in all the bearings
of the scene--the table with its untasted dessert; the shaded lamp;
the closed curtains of red damask; the thoughtful figure in the
easy chair. Although the weather was yet warm, a fire blazed in the
grate; but the windows were open behind the crimson curtains, and
the evening air stole gently in. It was like stepping into a
picture by Gerard Dow, so closed, so glowing, so rich in color.</p>
<p>"Mr. Arbuthnot," said the smart waiter, flinging the door very
wide open, and lingering to see what might follow.</p>
<p>The lady rose slowly, bowed, waved her hand towards a chair at
some distance from her own, and resumed her seat. The waiter
reluctantly left the room.</p>
<p>"I had not intended, sir, to give you the trouble of coming
here," said Mademoiselle de Sainte Aulaire, using her fan as a
handscreen, and speaking in a low, and, as it seemed to me, a
somewhat constrained voice. I could not see her face, but something
in the accent made my heart leap.</p>
<p>"Pray do not name it, madam," I said. "It is nothing."</p>
<p>She bent her head, as if thanking me, and went on:--</p>
<p>"I have come to this place," she said, "in order to prosecute
certain inquiries which are of great importance to myself. May I
ask if you are a native of Saxonholme?"</p>
<p>"I am."</p>
<p>"Were you here in the year 18--?"</p>
<p>"I was."</p>
<p>"Will you give me leave to test your memory respecting some
events that took place about that time?"</p>
<p>"By all means."</p>
<p>Mademoiselle de Sainte Aulaire thanked me with a gesture,
withdrew her chair still farther from the radius of the lamp and
the tire, and said:--</p>
<p>"I must entreat your patience if I first weary you with one or
two particulars of my family history,"</p>
<p>"Madam, I listen."</p>
<p>During the brief pause that ensued, I tried vainly to
distinguish something more of her features. I could only trace the
outline of a slight and graceful figure, the contour of a very
slender hand, and the ample folds of a dark silk dress.</p>
<p>At length, in a low, sweet voice, she began:--</p>
<p>"Not to impose upon you any dull genealogical details," she
said, "I will begin by telling you that the Sainte Aulaires are an
ancient French family of Bearnais extraction, and that my
grandfather was the last Marquis who bore the title. Holding large
possessions in the <i>comtat</i> of Venaissin (a district which now
forms part of the department of Vaucluse) and other demesnes at
Montlh&eacute;ry, in the province of the Ile de France---"</p>
<p>"At Montlh&eacute;ry!" I exclaimed, suddenly recovering the lost
link in my memory.</p>
<p>"The Sainte Aulaires," continued the lady, without pausing to
notice my interruption, "were sufficiently wealthy to keep up their
social position, and to contract alliances with many of the best
families in the south of France. Towards the early part of the
reign of Louis XIII. they began to be conspicuous at court, and
continued to reside in and near Paris up to the period of the
Revolution. Marshals of France, Envoys, and Ministers of State
during a period of nearly a century and a half, the Sainte Aulaires
had enjoyed too many honors not to be among the first of those who
fell in the Reign of Terror. My grandfather, who, as I have already
said, was the last Marquis bearing the title, was seized with his
wife and daughter at his Ch&acirc;teau near Montlh&eacute;ry in the
spring-time of 1793, and carried to La Force. Thence, after a mock
trial, they were all three conveyed to execution, and publicly
guillotined on the sixth of June in the same year. Do you follow
me?"</p>
<p>"Perfectly."</p>
<p>"One survivor, however, remained in the person of Charles
Armand, Pr&eacute;v&ocirc;t de Sainte Aulaire, only son of the
Marquis, then a youth of seventeen years of age, and pursuing his
studies in the seclusion of an old family seat in Vaucluse. He fled
into Italy. In the meantime, his inheritance was confiscated; and
the last representative of the race, reduced to exile and beggary,
assumed another name. It were idle to attempt to map out his life
through the years that followed. He wandered from land to land;
lived none knew how; became a tutor, a miniature-painter, a
volunteer at Naples under General Pepe, a teacher of languages in
London, corrector of the press to a publishing house in
Brussels--everything or anything, in short, by which he could
honorably earn his bread. During these years of toil and poverty,
he married. The lady was an orphan, of Scotch extraction, poor and
proud as himself, and governess in a school near Brussels. She died
in the third year of their union, and left him with one little
daughter. This child became henceforth his only care and happiness.
While she was yet a mere infant, he placed her in the school where
her mother had been teacher. There she remained, first as pupil,
by-and-by as governess, for more than sixteen years. The child was
called by an old family name that had been her grandmother's and
her great-grandmother's in the high and palmy days of the Sainte
Aulaires--Hortense."</p>
<p>"Hortense!" I cried, rising from my chair.</p>
<p>"It is not an uncommon name," said the lady. "Does it surprise
you?"</p>
<p>"I--I beg your pardon, madam," I stammered, resuming my seat. "I
once had a dear friend of that name. Pray, go on."</p>
<p>"For ten years the refugee contrived to keep his little Hortense
in the safe and pleasant shelter of her Flemish home. He led a
wandering life, no one knew where; and earned his money, no one
knew how. Travel-worn and careworn, he was prematurely aged, and at
fifty might well have been mistaken for a man of sixty-five or
seventy. Poor and broken as he was, however, Monsieur de Sainte
Aulaire was every inch a gentleman of the old school; and his
little girl was proud of him, when he came to the school to see
her. This, however, was very seldom--never oftener than twice or
three times in the year. When she saw him for the last time,
Hortense was about thirteen years of age. He looked paler, and
thinner, and poorer than ever; and when he bade her farewell, it
was as if under the presentiment that they might meet no more. He
then told her, for the first time, something of his story, and left
with her at parting a small coffer containing his decorations, a
few trinkets that had been his mother's, and his sword--the badge
of his nobility."</p>
<p>The lady's voice faltered. I neither spoke nor stirred, but sat
like a man of stone.</p>
<p>Then she went on again:--</p>
<p>"The father never came again. The child, finding herself after a
certain length of time thrown upon the charity of her former
instructors, was glad to become under-teacher in their school. The
rest of her history may be told in a few words. From under-teacher
she became head-teacher, and at eighteen passed as governess into a
private family. At twenty she removed to Paris, and set foot for
the first time in the land of her fathers. All was now changed in
France. The Bourbons reigned again, and her father, had he
reappeared, might have reclaimed his lost estates. She sought him
far and near. She employed agents to discover him. She could not
believe that he was dead. To be once again clasped in his arms--to
bring him back to his native country---to see him resume his name
and station--this was the bright dream of her life. To accomplish
these things she labored in many ways, teaching and writing; for
Hortense also was proud--too proud to put forward an unsupported
claim. For with her father were lost the title-deeds and papers
that might have made the daughter wealthy, and she had no means of
proving her identity. Still she labored heartily, lived poorly, and
earned enough to push her inquiries far and wide--even to journey
hither and thither, whenever she fancied, alas! that a clue had
been found. Twice she travelled into Switzerland, and once into
Italy, but always in vain. The exile had too well concealed, even
from her, his <i>sobriquet</i> and his calling, and Hortense at
last grew weary of failure. One fact, however, she succeeded in
discovering, and only one--namely, that her father had, many years
before, made some attempt to establish his claims to the estates,
but that he had failed for want either of sufficient proof, or of
means to carry on the <i>proc&eacute;s</i>. Of even this
circumstance only a meagre law-record remained, and she could
succeed in learning no more. Since then, a claim has been advanced
by a remote branch of the Sainte Aulaire family, and the cause is,
even now, in course of litigation."</p>
<p>She paused, as if fatigued by so long talking; but, seeing me
about to speak, prevented me with a gesture of the hand, and
resumed:--</p>
<p>"Hortense de Ste. Aulaire continued to live in Paris for nearly
five years, at the end of which time she left it to seek out the
members of her mother's family. Finding them kindly disposed
towards her, she took up her abode amongst them in the calm
seclusion of a remote Scotch town. There, even there, she still
hoped, still employed agents; still yearned to discover, if not her
father, at least her father's grave. Several years passed thus. She
continued to earn a modest subsistence by her pen, till at length
the death of one of those Scotch relatives left her mistress of a
small inheritance. Money was welcome, since it enabled her to
pursue her task with renewed vigor. She searched farther and
deeper. A trivial circumstance eagerly followed up brought a train
of other circumstances to light. She discovered that her father had
assumed a certain name; she found that the bearer of this name was
a wandering man, a conjuror by trade; she pursued the vague traces
of his progress from town to town, from county to county, sometimes
losing, sometimes regaining the scattered links. Sir, he was my
father--I am that Hortense. I have spent my life seeking him--I
have lived for this one hope. I have traced his footsteps here to
Saxonholme, and here the last clue fails. If you know anything--if
you can remember anything---"</p>
<p>Calm and collected as she had been at first, she was trembling
now, and her voice died away in sobs. The firelight fell upon her
face--upon the face of my lost love!</p>
<p>I also was profoundly agitated.</p>
<p>"Hortense," I said, "do you not know, that he who stood beside
your father in his last hour, and he who so loved you years ago,
are one and the same? Alas! why did you not tell me these things
long since?"</p>
<p>"Did <i>you</i> stand beside my father's deathbed?" she asked
brokenly.</p>
<p>"I did."</p>
<p>She clasped her hands over her eyes and shuddered, as if beneath
the pressure of a great physical pain.</p>
<p>"O God!" she murmured, "so many years of denial and suffering!
so many years of darkness that might have been dispelled by a
word!"</p>
<p>We were both silent for a long time. Then I told her all that I
remembered of her father; how he came to Saxonholme--how he fell
ill--how he died, and was buried. It was a melancholy recital;
painful for me to relate--painful for her to hear--and interrupted
over and over again by questions and tears, and bursts of
unavailing sorrow.</p>
<p>"We will visit his grave to-morrow," I said, when all was
told.</p>
<p>She bent her head.</p>
<p>"To-morrow, then," said she, "I end the pilgrimage of
years."</p>
<p>"And--and afterwards?" I faltered.</p>
<p>"Afterwards? Alas! friend, when the hopes of years fall suddenly
to dust and ashes, one feels as if there were no future to
follow?"</p>
<p>"It is true," I said gloomily. "I know it too well."</p>
<p>"You know it?" she exclaimed, looking up.</p>
<p>"I know it, Hortense. There was a moment in which all the hope,
and the fulness, and the glory of my life went down at a blow. Have
you not heard of ships that have gone to the bottom in fair
weather, suddenly, with all sail set, and every hand on board?"</p>
<p>She looked at me with a strange earnestness in her eyes, and
sighed heavily.</p>
<p>"What have you been doing all this time, fellow-student?" she
asked, after a pause.</p>
<p>The old name sounded very sweet upon her lips!</p>
<p>"I? Alas!--nothing."</p>
<p>"But you are a surgeon, are you not?"</p>
<p>"No. I never even went up for examination. I gave up all idea of
medicine as a profession when my father died."</p>
<p>"What are you, then?"</p>
<p>"An idler upon the great highway--a book-dreamer--a library
fixture."</p>
<p>Hortense looked at me thoughtfully, with her cheek resting on
her hand.</p>
<p>"Have you done nothing but read and dream?"</p>
<p>"Not quite. I have travelled."</p>
<p>"With what object?"</p>
<p>"A purely personal one. I was alone and unhappy, and--"</p>
<p>"And fancied that purposeless wandering was better for you than
healthy labor. Well, you have travelled, and you have read books.
What more?"</p>
<p>"Nothing more, except--"</p>
<p>"Except what?"</p>
<p>I chanced to have one of the papers in my pocket, and so drew it
out, and placed it before her.</p>
<p>"I have been a rhymer as well as a dreamer," I said, shyly.
"Perhaps the rhymes grew out of the dreams, as the dreams
themselves grew out of something else which has been underlying my
life this many a year. At all events I have hewn a few of them into
shape, and trusted them to paper and type--and here is a critique
which came to me this morning with some three or four others."</p>
<p>She took the paper with a smile half of wonder, half of
kindness, and, glancing quickly through it, said:--</p>
<p>"This is well. This is very well. I must read the book. Will you
lend it to me?"</p>
<p>"I will give it to you," I replied; "if I can give you that
which is already yours."</p>
<p>"Already mine?"</p>
<p>"Yes, as the poet in me, however worthless, is all and only
yours! Do you suppose, Hortense, that I have ever ceased to love
you? As my songs are born of my sorrow, so my sorrow was born of my
love; and love, and sorrow, and song, such as they are, are of your
making."</p>
<p>"Hush!" she said, with something of her old gay indifference.
"Your literary sins must not be charged upon me, fellow-student! I
have enough of my own to answer for. Besides, I am not going to
acquit you so easily. Granted that you have written a little book
of poetry--what then? Have you done nothing else? Nothing active?
Nothing manly? Nothing useful?"</p>
<p>"If by usefulness and activity you mean manual labor, I
certainly have neither felled a tree, nor ploughed a field, nor
hammered a horse-shoe. I have lived by thought alone."</p>
<p>"Then I fear you have lived a very idle life," said Hortense,
smiling. "Are you married?"</p>
<p>"Married!" I echoed, indignantly. "How can you ask the
question?"</p>
<p>"You are not a magistrate?"</p>
<p>"Certainly not."</p>
<p>"In short, then, you are perfectly useless. You play no part,
domestic or public. You serve neither the state nor the community.
You are a mere cypher--a make-weight in the social scale--an
article of no value to any one except the owner."</p>
<p>"Not even the latter, mademoiselle," I replied, bitterly. "It is
long since I have ceased to value my own life."</p>
<p>She smiled again, but her eyes this time were full of tears.</p>
<p>"Nay," said she, softly, "am I not the owner?"</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>Great joys at first affect us like great griefs. We are stunned
by them, and know not how deep they are till the night comes with
its solemn stillness, and we are alone with our own hearts. Then
comes the season of thankfulness, and wonder and joy. Then our
souls rise up within us, and chant a hymn of praise; and the great
vault of Heaven is as the roof of a mighty cathedral studded with
mosaics of golden stars, and the night winds join in with the bass
of their mighty organ-pipes; and the poplars rustle, like the
leaves of the hymn-books in the hands of the congregation.</p>
<p>So it was with me that evening when I went forth into the quiet
fields where the summer moon was shining, and knew that Hortense
was mine at last--mine now and for ever. Overjoyed and restless, I
wandered about for hours. I could not go home. I felt I must
breathe the open air of the hills, and tread the dewy grass, and
sing my hymn of praise and thanksgiving after my own fashion. At
length, as the dawning light came widening up the east, I turned my
steps homewards, and before the sun had risen above the farthest
pine-ridge, I was sleeping the sweetest sleep that had been mine
for years.</p>
<p>The conjuror's grave was green with grass and purple with wild
thyme when Hortense knelt beside it, and there consummated the
weary pilgrimage of half a life. The sapling willow had spread its
arms above him in a pleasant canopy, leaning farther and reaching
higher, year by year,</p>
<p>"And lo! the twig to which they laid his head had now become a
tree!"</p>
<p>Hortense found nothing of her father but this grave. Papers and
title-deeds there were none.</p>
<p>I well remembered the anxious search made thirteen years ago,
when not even a card was found to indicate the whereabouts of his
friends or family. Not to lose the vestige of a chance, we pushed
inquiry farther; but in vain. Our rector, now a very old man,
remembered nothing of the wandering lecturer. Mine host and hostess
of the Red Lion were both dead. The Red Lion itself had
disappeared, and become a thing of tradition. All was lost and
forgotten; and of all her hereditary wealth, station, and honors,
Hortense de Sainte Aulaire retained nothing but her father's sword
and her ancestral name.</p>
<p>--Not even the latter for many weeks, O discerning reader! for
before the golden harvest was gathered in, we two were wedded.</p>

<h3>BRINGETH THIS TRUE STORY TO AN END.</h3>
<center>Ye who have traced the pilgrim to the scene<br>
Which is his last, if in your memories dwell<br>
A thought that once was his, if on ye swell<br>
A single recollection, not in vain<br>
He wore his sandal shoon and scallop-shell.<br>
<br>
BYRON.</center>
<br>
<p>Having related the story of my life as it happened, incident by
incident, and brought it down to that point at which stories are
wont to end, I find that I have little to add respecting others. My
narrative from first to last has been purely personal. The one love
of my life was Hortense--the one friend of my life, Oscar
Dalrymple. The catalogue of my acquaintances would scarcely number
so many names as I have fingers on one hand. The two first are
still mine; the latter, having been brought forward only in so far
as they re-acted upon my feelings or modified my experiences, have
become, for the most part, mere memories, and so vanish,
ghost-like, from the page. Franz M&uuml;ller is studying in Rome,
having carried off a prize at the Ecole des Beaux Arts, which
entitles him to three years at the Villa Medici, that Ultima Thule
of the French art-student's ambition. I hear that he is as full of
whim and jest as ever, and the very life of the Caf&eacute; Greco.
May I some day hear his pleasant laugh again! Dr. Ch&eacute;ron, I
believe, is still practising in Paris; and Monsieur de Simoncourt,
I have no doubt, continues to exercise the profession of Chevalier
d'Industrie, with such failures and successes as are incidental to
that career.</p>
<p>As for my early <i>amourettes</i>, they have disappeared from my
path as utterly as though they had never crossed it. Of Madame de
Marignan, I have neither heard, nor desired to hear, more. Even
Josephine's pretty face is fast fading from my memory. It is ever
thus with the transient passions of <i>our premi&egrave;re
jeunesse.</i> We believe in them for the moment, and waste laughter
and tears, chaplets and sackcloth, upon them. Presently the
delusion passes; the earnest heart within us is awakened; and we
know that till now we have been mere actors in "a masquerade of
dreams." The chaplets were woven of artificial flowers. The funeral
was a mock funeral--the banquet a stage feast of painted fruits and
empty goblets! Alas! we cannot undo that foolish past. We may only
hope to blot it out with after records of high, and wise, and
tender things. Thus it is that the young man's heart is like the
precious palimpsest of old. He first of all defiles it with idle
anacreontics in praise of love and wine; but, erasing these
by-and-by with his own pious hand, he writes it over afresh with
chronicles of a pure and holy passion, and dedicates it to the fair
saint of all his orisons.</p>
<p>Dalrymple and his wife are now settled in Italy, having
purchased a villa in the neighborhood of Spezzia, where they live
in great retirement. In their choice of such retirement they are
influenced by more than one good reason. In the first place, the
death of the Vicomte de Caylus was an event likely to be productive
of many unpleasant consequences to one who had deprived the French
government of so distinguished an officer. In the next, Dalrymple
is a poor man, and his wife is no longer rich; so that Italy agrees
with their means as well as with their tastes. Lastly, they love
each other so well that they never weary of their solitude, nor
care to barter away their blue Italian skies and solemn pine-woods
for the glittering unrest of society.</p>
<p>Fascinated by Dalrymple's description of his villa and the life
he led in it, Hortense and I made up our minds some few weeks after
our marriage, to visit that part of Italy--perhaps, in case we were
much pleased with it, to settle there, for at least a few years. So
I prepared once more to leave my father's house; this time to let
it, for I knew that I should never live in it again.</p>
<p>It took some weeks to clear the old place out. The thing was
necessary; yet I felt as if it were a kind of sacrilege. To disturb
the old dust upon the library-shelves and select such books as I
cared to keep; to sort and destroy all kinds of hoarded papers; to
ransack desks that had never been unlocked since the hands that
last closed them were laid to rest for ever, constituted my share
of the work. Hortense superintended the rest. As for the household
goods, we resolved to keep nothing, save a few old family portraits
and my father's plate, some of which had descended to us through
two or three centuries.</p>
<p>While yet in this unsettled state, with the house all in
confusion and the time appointed for our journey drawing nearer and
nearer day by day, a strange thing happened.</p>
<p>At the end of the garden, encroaching partly upon a corner of
it, and opening into the lane that bounded it on the other side of
the hedge, stood the stable belonging to the house.</p>
<p>It had been put to no use since my father's time, and was now so
thoroughly out of repair that I resolved to have it pulled down and
rebuilt before letting it to strangers. In the meantime, I went
down there one morning with a workman before the work of demolition
was begun.</p>
<p>We had some difficulty to get in, for the lock and hinges were
rusted, and the floor within was choked with fallen rubbish. At
length we forced an entrance. I thought I had never seen a more
dreary interior. My father's old chaise was yet standing there,
with both wheels off. The mouldy harness was dropping to pieces on
the walls. The beams were festooned with cobwebs. The very ladder
leading to the loft above was so rotten that I scarcely dared trust
to it for a footing.</p>
<p>Having trusted to it, however, I found myself in a still more
ruinous and dreary hole. The posts supporting the roof were
insecure; the tiles were all displaced overhead; and the rafters
showed black and bare against the sky in many places. In one corner
lay a heap of mouldy straw, and at the farther end, seen dimly
through the darkness, a pile of old lumber, and--by Heaven! the
pagoda-canopy of many colors, and the little Chevalier's Conjuring
Table!</p>
<p>I could scarcely believe my eyes. My poor Hortense! Here, at
last, were some relics of her father; but found in how strange a
place, and by how strange a chance!</p>
<p>I had them dragged out into the light, all mildewed and
cob-webbed as they were; whereupon an army of spiders rushed out in
every direction, a bat rose up, shrieking, and whirled in blind
circles overhead. In a corner of the pagoda we found an empty
bird's-nest. The table was small, and could be got out without much
difficulty; so I helped the workman to carry it down the ladder,
and sending it on before me to the house, sauntered back through
the glancing shadows of the acacia-leaves, musing upon the way in
which these long-forgotten things had been brought to light, and
wondering how they came to be stored away in my own stable.</p>
<p>"Do you know anything about it, Collins?" I said, coming up
suddenly behind him in the hall.</p>
<p>"About what, sir?" asked that respectable servant, looking round
with some perplexity, as if in search of the nominative.</p>
<p>I pointed to the table, now being carried into the dismantled
dining-room.</p>
<p>Collins smiled--he had a remarkably civil, apologetic way of
smiling behind his hand, as if it were a yawn or a liberty.</p>
<p>"Oh, sir," said he, "don't you remember? To be sure, you were
quite a young gentleman at that time--but---"</p>
<p>"But what?" I interrupted, impatiently.</p>
<p>"Why, sir, that table once belonged to a poor little conjuring
chap who called himself Almond Pudding, and died...."</p>
<p>I checked him with a gesture.</p>
<p>"I know all that," I said, hastily. "I remember it perfectly;
but how came the things into my stable?"</p>
<p>"Your respected father and my honored master, sir, had them
conveyed there when the Red Lion was sold off," said Collins, with
a sidelong glance at the dining-room door. "He was of opinion, sir,
that they might some day identify the poor man to his relatives, in
case of inquiry."</p>
<p>I heard the sound of a suppressed sob, and, brushing past him
without another word, went in and closed the door.</p>
<p>"My own Hortense!" I said, taking her into my arms. "My
wife!"</p>
<p>Pale and tearful, she lifted her face from my shoulder, and
pointed to the table.</p>
<p>"I know what it is," she faltered. "You need not tell me. My
heart tells me!"</p>
<p>I led her to a chair, and explained how and where it had been
found. I even told her of the little empty nest from which the
young birds had long since flown away. In this tiny incident there
was something pathetic that soothed her; so, presently, when she
left off weeping, we examined the table together.</p>
<p>It was a quaint, fragile, ricketty thing, with slender twisted
legs of black wood, and a cloth-covered top that had once been
green, but now retained no vestige of its original color. This
cloth top was covered with slender slits of various shapes and
sizes, round, square, sexagonal, and so forth, which, being pressed
with the finger, fell inwards and disclosed little hiding-places
sunk in the well of the table; but which, as soon as the pressure
was removed, flew up again by means of concealed springs, and
closed as neatly as before.</p>
<p>"This is strange," said Hortense, peering into one of the
recesses. "I have found something in the table! Look--it is a
watch!"</p>
<p>I snatched it from her, and carried it to the window. Blackened
and discolored as it was, I recognised it instantly.</p>
<p>It was my own watch--my own watch of which I was so boyishly
vain years and years ago, and which I had lost so unaccountably on
the night of the Chevalier's performance! There were my initials
engraved on the back, amid a forest of flourishes, and there on the
dial was that identical little Cupid with the cornucopia of
flowers, which I once thought such a miracle of workmanship! Alas!
what a mighty march old Time had stolen upon me, while that little
watch was standing still!</p>
<p>"Oh, Heaven!--oh, husband!"</p>
<p>Startled from my reverie more by the tone than the words, I
turned and saw Hortense with a packet of papers in her hand--old,
yellow, dusty papers, tied together with a piece of black
ribbon.</p>
<p>"I found them there--there--there!" she faltered, pointing to a
drawer in the table which I now saw for the first time. "I chanced
to press that little knob, and the drawer flew out. Oh, my dear
father!--see, Basil, here are his patents of nobility--here is the
certificate of my birth--here are the title-deeds of the manor of
Sainte Aulaire! This alone was wanted to complete our
happiness!"</p>
<p>"We will keep the table, Hortense, all our lives!" I explained,
when the first agitation was past.</p>
<p>"As sacredly," replied she, "as it kept this precious
secret!"</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>My task is done. Here on my desk lies the piled-up manuscript
which has been my companion through so many pleasant hours. Those
hours are over now. I may lay down my pen, and put aside the
whispering vine-leaves from my casement, and lean out into the
sweet Italian afternoon, as idly as though I wore to the climate
and the manner born.</p>
<p>The world to-day is only half awake. The little white town,
crouched down by the "beached margent" of the bay, winks with its
glittering windows and dozes in the sunshine. The very cicalas are
silent. The fishermen's barques, with their wing-like sails all
folded to rest, rock lazily at anchor, like sea-birds asleep. The
cork-trees nod languidly to each other; and not even yonder
far-away marble peaks are more motionless than that cloud which
hangs like a white banner in the sky. Hush! I can almost believe
that I hear the drowsy washing of the tide against the ruined tower
on the beach.</p>
<p>And this is the bay of Spezzia--the lovely, treacherous bay of
Spezzia, where our English Shelley lost his gentle life! How blue
those cruel waters are to-day! Bluer, by Heaven! than the sky, with
scarce a ripple setting to the shore.</p>
<p>We are very happy in our remote Italian home. It stands high
upon a hill-side, and looks down over a slope of silvery olives to
the sea. Vineyard and orange grove, white town, blue bay, and amber
sands lie mapped out beneath our feet. Not a felucca "to Spezzia
bound from Cape Circella" can sail past without our
observation.</p>
<blockquote>"Not a sun can die, nor yet be born, unseen<br>
By dwellers at my villa."</blockquote>
<p>Nay, from this very window, one might almost pitch an orange
into the empty vettura standing in the courtyard of the Croce di
Malta!</p>
<p>Then we have a garden--a wild, uncultured place, where figs and
lemons, olives "blackening sullen ripe," and prickly aloes flourish
in rank profusion, side by side; and a loggia, where we sit at
twilight drinking our Chianti wine and listening to the
nightingales; and a study looking out on the bay through a trellis
of vine-leaves, where we read and write together, surrounded by our
books. Here, also, just opposite my desk, hangs M&uuml;ller's copy
of that portrait of the Marquise de Sainte Aulaire, which I once
gave to Hortense, and which is now my own again. How often I pause
upon the unturned page, how often lay my pen aside, to look from
the painting to the dear, living face beneath it! For there she
sits, day after day, my wife! my poet! with the side-light falling
on her hair, and the warm sea-breezes stirring the soft folds of
her dress. Sometimes she lifts her eyes, those wondrous eyes,
luminous from within "with the light of the rising soul"--and then
we talk awhile of our work, or of our love, believing ever that</p>
<blockquote>"Our work shall still be better for our love,<br>
And still our love be sweeter for our work."</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the original of that same painting in the study may yet
be ours some day, with the old ch&acirc;teau in which it hangs, and
all the broad lands belonging thereunto. Our claim has been put
forward some time now, and our lawyers are confident of success.
Shall we be happier, if that success is ours? Can rank add one
grace, or wealth one pleasure, to a life which is already so
perfect? I think not, and there are moments when I almost wish that
we may never have it in our power to test the question.</p>
<p>But stay! the hours fly past. The sun is low, and the tender
Italian twilight will soon close in. Then, when the moon rises, we
shall sail out upon the bay in our own tiny felucca; or perhaps go
down through the town to that white villa gleaming out above the
dark tops of yonder cypresses, and spend some pleasant hours with
Dalrymple and his wife. They, too, are very happy; but their
happiness is of an older date than ours, and tends to other ends.
They have bought lands in the neighborhood, which they cultivate;
and they have children whom they adore. To educate these little
ones for the wide world lying beyond that blue bay and the far-off
mountains, is the one joy, the one care of their lives. Truly has
it been said that</p>
<blockquote>"A happy family<br>
Is but an earlier heaven."</blockquote>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
